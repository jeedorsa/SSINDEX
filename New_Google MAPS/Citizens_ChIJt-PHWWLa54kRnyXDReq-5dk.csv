They have ZERO concern over customer satisfaction, simply look at the numerous negative reviews and the fact that they don't even care enough to reply.  We paid off a HELOC in 2021 and Citizens never reported it as closed. Spent two weeks trying to get that documentation when we sold the house and Citizens offered no assistance. Had to pay a third party  and wait several weeks to verify what should have taken Citizens 20 minutes to confirm with the closing attorney.",1

The customer service is terrible, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend them to a soul to do business here. Now I have to take time off of work and go in person to rectify my issue when a simple phone call would have cleared some things up. Do better hamden! Zero stars!

Update: days later and still no response!",1

My personal (as far as I'm concerned) banker ""Kyle"" has gone out of his way on several occasions to make MY experience at this financial institution, a simple, yet memorable experience. ( in a positive way)
I've absolutely the UTMOST RESPECT and APPRECIATION for ALL of the employees within Citizens Bank üè¶ üëè! They're nothing short of amazing when it comes to making you genuinely feel more like family, than just another account number on the green screen.",5
11/08/2019 18:22:49,Jayme Clark,"I was incentivized to open a checking account in addition to a business account 5 months ago with the promise that I would receive a $300 bonus. The individual opening my account confirmed the amount needed to open the account (she actually assisted in filling out a direct deposit form for my employer) but did not disclose that it needed to be a lump sum deposit so I have not received this bonus. This has felt to be a very dishonest practice and a poor treatment of customers. I've called Citizens customer service who referred me to the branch. I spoke with an account manager two weeks ago who stated they will have the branch manager call me back, they did not. I called today to attempt to speak to the branch manager, they have not called me back. Poor customer service and so disheartened by their treatment.",1

It always feels like seeing family when I come in, it even looks like a house. Out of all the banks I've had experience with, this is the most friendly and clean and best bank. This branch especially!!! After a visit once in a while they will call to see how the visit went. Love that aspect as well!",5

12/20/2017 19:37:02,Michael Stewart,I find the staff here at this branch to be very cold and un welcoming. I have tried it several times and just avoid it at this point. The entire staff seem to lack all social skills and are miserable.,1
