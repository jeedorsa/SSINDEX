09/19/2023 02:56:58,roy flowers,Absolutely my worst banking experience ever. I'm a business owner with a business account. The teller Enrico was attempting to talk to me like we were standing on the street corner. He also did a terrible job with my paperwork. So I had to go back to the bank and straighten it out. I told the manager at the branch about my experience. Not only did he go out of his way to try to NOT resolve the error. He told me he's banker is the nicest guy he knows. I guess birds of a feather flock together.  I'll be closing my account at fifth third. And it's because of this location  601 s. Clark. If you want courtesy and a pleasant banking experience never go there.,1

I had a hold on my account due to a sensitive fraud issue with one of my checks that I was working out with the issuer of the check and as I begin to explain this to Gary he cuts me off and screams and I mean HOLLERS across the entire bank “hey Rico they got fraud on the account its a fraud hold I can’t help you with that you gotta go over there. AY RICO THIS ONES A FRAUD HOLD COMING OVER TO YOU!” In front of the entire lobby which had about 8-12 people in it. Completely humiliating. And as I was getting helped by Rico who very clearly hates everything about his job and referred to me as bro throughout the entire interaction,  i heard Gary screaming at a lady in the drive thru “ok well I don’t know you give me some ID or something how the hell am I supposed to know who you are? you think I memorize everyone’s account numbers? That would be illegal.”

Like I don’t know if his employment is part of some kind of Tourette’s outreach program or if you’re spearheading some kind of campaign to get people with zero social grace and the professionalism and discretion of a circus monkey back out into the work force, but I closed my account that day. F v c k that.",1

I was in the drive thru and asked could I receive the access 360 card or do I have to go inside and he immediately caught a attitude and told me I had to come inside for that service which was fine with me I just wanted to make sure .. I then asked to withdraw money from my account and his whole demeanor and responses were as if I was irritating him he didn't greet me , say thank you, didn't ask how I wanted my money I withdrew back or anything.... he put the envelope n the window shoot and walked away didn't even ask if I needed anything else... after sitting there for 3 mins more I noticed he gave me all $100 bills he was so nasty and rude I didn't even want to continue service to tell him I needed $20 bills !!!! I don't have to come to this bank or fifth third for that matter if your going to employ people like this if you don't like your job retire",1

07/24/2021 16:43:14,J Torres,"Scheduled an appointment online to speak with a banker regarding a mortgage. After waiting 20min, and not being seen with no estimated time when I would be seen I left. Why make appointments if they can not be honored? Why take a walk-in when someone scheduled an appointment. Needless to say, they won't get my business.",1

I don't think I'm abusing the bank's parking ,I don't want to go to a bank with no washroom and have fear about the safety of my car. I don't want somebody is constantly watching me. Overall you guys are not friendly and very good with kicking out the customers.",1
