Because I travel and depend upon paying my bills on-line from wherever I am, on-line banking internationally is critical for me. I never had a problem when it was Peoples. In the last 2-3 weeks, M&T has blocked my access to my checking account twice, despite a travel notification in place. Because I am out of the country and the time it took to correct the error ( it was apparently the Fraud Unit), the cellphone charges were enormous. There is no way to contact the bank by e-mail if you are blocked and you can't call 800 numbers from outside the US or Canada. I am reconsidering whether I can remain an M&T customer and would warn others that if you travel outside the US, even with a travel notification in place, you may not be able to access your account on-line. This is a major flaw in M&T Service.",1

If you have a Safe Deposit Box at this branch that you have jewelry in or something similar and haven't checked that box in a long time, I suggest you do it as soon as possible. I believe that jewelry I had in my SDB is missing. If more of us find this to be true, we may have to address the issue with the bank. I suggest that you write a review if you find something of monetary value from your SDB is gone.",2
08/14/2021 12:11:54,Amelia Govang,I opened a passbook savings account years ago. I hoped it would help me save money not being so readily available. I hadn't made a deposit in a year or more so decided to make a deposit today. Unaware to me they had been charging me $10 a month for an inactive account. The bank had withdrawn over $100 in fees. Be careful! I would never do any of my banking with Peoples again!,1

08/11/2018 14:22:32,Amanda Morrone,Branch Employees are great at this branch. The account fees and requirements are reasonable and so are the loan rates. Plus the regional office for New Haven area is located here .,4
