04/03/2024 16:31:48,Magically Delicious!,"I don't understand all the negative reviews. I've always had great interactions here, the manager is friendly and has rescinded my overdraft fees a few times. Any bank will do this if you're just polite and friendly. So if you get an overdraft, just ask nicely. Don't call or visit with an attitude. And surveillance cameras are there for a reason. No matter who comes in the bank they video. Whether you're white, black, Asian, Middle Eastern, Slavic, what have you. If you want to see racism everywhere, you will.",5
01/04/2024 21:12:36,Dillon,The worst bank I've ever dealt with. I got scammed and they never gave me my money back. No wonder they're going out of business I switched to TD Bank. They are way better,1
09/19/2023 12:41:40,Sean Barros,"Where do I even start. This bank and citizens in general apparently doesn‚Äôt have a customer service after hours. Not only that but if you plan on using their mobile app, don‚Äôt bother because it barely works. I have had numerous fraud issues and normally when you claim fraud the funds will populate within the first few days, nope not with me. I am beyond frustrated with this bank. It has caused me nothing but headaches. When I try to call the branch and they attempt to transfer me to a customer service number I get disconnected.if I could give this bank a zero I absolutely would. Thank you for making my decision to bank elsewhere an easy one. I must add, I went into the bank to ‚Äúclose‚Äù out my accounts to just find out that they‚Äôre still open. So when I called their ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù they mentioned that their system was updating and I would need to call back in a few hours. I‚Äôm truly disappointed and disgusted. You should be ashamed of yourselves Fransico",1
09/27/2023 13:11:23,Bruce H,This might be the worst bank with the worst customer service. Everyone that works there should be digging latrines instead of working with people. Don't try to use the app as it will crash. Don't try to call cs as the wait time is not worth them fumbling over HOW TO SPELL YOUR NAME. I hope this bank goes under in the next crash and the employees fired!,1
08/09/2023 17:04:56,JOSEPHINE APONTE,Citizens Bank is not a people friendly bank. They hit you with overdraft fees even for zelle payments. They took the money out of my account then charged with with an overdraft fee because they decided to process a bill payment on that Monday and use the zelle money for that- then processed the zelle payment after. Thats not right. Then even though I lost my checkbook-they wanted to charge me with a fee to stop all ach payments from coming out of the account. No good! Not friendly! Im closing this account,1

But I will make an exception for this bank and everyone working there to be put out on the street! Worst customer service ALL AROUND including online, on the phone and in person. Avoid this bank it suckkkksssss!",1
12/23/2021 04:12:05,Wilmarie,"Went into the branch to get some information about refinancing my student loans and Shaira Contreras the banker in there was amazing. She was so polite, knowledgeable, sincere, and welcoming. I will be sending all my friends and family to this branch. She truly makes you feel comfortable and listen to all your needs. Citizens did a great job in hiring such a talented banker.",5

03/29/2023 22:55:07,Glenn Catania Sr,Customer Service skills needs updating. How does a bank employee walk away from a customer in the middle of a conversation? Seriously?,1
10/19/2022 22:02:55,Kevin A Mendez,Every time I go to this bank to deposit my cash in singles into my business account the head supervisor is giving me a hard time saying I'm bringing to much singles. Telling me not to come with some much singles. I guess I'll be taking my singles I'm cash to another bank. Bad customer service,1
05/11/2019 15:17:49,Jasmine Roberts,"I would give this place a zero stars if I could. I don‚Äôt recommend any person of color to patronize this location. I went in to cash a settlement check from my lawyer, I didn‚Äôt wait long but I noticed that there‚Äôs a surveillance screen on the counter trained on the patrons in the lobby. I thought that it was strange because I‚Äôve never seen that in a bank before and it was turned towards the lobby so I could see myself and the other customers on the screen. I wrote it off at first until I approached the counter. When I looked back toward the screen the only person on it was me. There was another woman at the counter doing the same thing I was (cashing checks) but my face was plastered all over the screen. Plus the security guard who was standing by the door when I walked in suddenly was standing 3 feet behind me. The teller was ‚Äúfriendly-ish‚Äù but had the nerve to hand me a business card asking me to come back. I was so embarrassed because all I was trying to do was cash a check I in no way was there to harm anyone. The blatent racial profiling was appalling and I‚Äôll never come back to another citizens bank if I can help it. Shame on you all!",1

12/06/2018 18:27:52,D X,"I was alone in the bank for 20 minutes while 5 employees were talking to each other. When I was finally attended, the service was slow and inefficient. The clerk seemed to be bored to be there.",1
