In addition to the personal service and the local branch folks knowing your name, M&T has always respected my time.

For example, I send an email to the branch every month and then come in to sign the paperwork for an int’l wire transfer. I was in the branch for no more than 2 1/2 minutes this morning to complete this month’s transfer! Very impressive.",5

We have spent 8 hours and four visits to the branch to get it settled. online or phone help = <<crickets>>> I highly recommend if you are looking for a bank in Ridgefield..try probably ANOHT other bank except this monstrocity. One person at branch TRIED and still she cannot access her accounts. So if the good people at the branch cannot even work with th new system, imagine and 87 yo woman trying to figure it out. AND i am helping online and I am not luddite...but even I cannot get it to work. BOO on M&T Bank for a careless and horrible transition.",1
