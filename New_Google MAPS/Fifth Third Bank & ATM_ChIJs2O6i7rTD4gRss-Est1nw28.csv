03/08/2024 22:32:46,Sorry Mate,"I've been banking at the 53rd Bank branch located at 5918 North Broadway, Chicago, IL 60660, for some time now, and unfortunately, my experiences have been far from satisfactory. Despite the branch's location in an area known for its safety challenges, my primary concern lies with the customer service, particularly the behavior of the tellers and the management team.

On numerous occasions, I've encountered issues with deposit errors. Despite providing clear written amounts on deposit slips, the amounts entered into the system by the tellers have often been incorrect. It appears as though there is a significant lack of training, or perhaps a disregard for accuracy and customer service, which is concerning.

Furthermore, the behavior of the branch manager has been particularly disappointing. Without knowing his name, he is identifiable by his short stature, bald head, and heavier build. His mannerisms towards customers are not only rude but also show a clear bias. In a neighborhood predominantly inhabited by the Black community, he exhibits impatience and a lack of respect, often rushing Black customers and making excuses such as broken machines or computer issues to expedite their departure. Conversely, his interactions with White customers are noticeably different, showcasing patience and a welcoming demeanor.

This differential treatment is unacceptable and goes against the principles of equality and non-discrimination that every institution, especially banks, should uphold. The lack of professionalism and evident bias not only tarnishes the bank's reputation but also affects the community's trust in this establishment.

I urge the management of 53rd Bank to address these issues promptly. Proper training and a thorough review of customer service practices are essential to ensure that all customers are treated with the respect and fairness they deserve. Until then, I am compelled to advise potential customers to consider their banking options carefully before deciding to bank with this branch.",1

07/18/2021 00:05:38,bearwoody,"Awful!  Took 2 buses from Edgewater to the Belmont and Clark location today to deposit checks, only to find that it has closed, and that there is a new location at Belmont and Sheffield (which is not on Google Maps by the way).  So I walked over there.  The card swipe was broken, so I couldn't enter the vestibule.  Then I walked to the Broadway and Addison location.  All they had was a beaten up 20th century exterior ATM.  Tried to deposit my checks there.  It accepted them, then told me that it couldn't deposit them, and spit them back out to me.  Took the bus home. Total waste of two and a half hours.  My experience was a FifthThird WORSE.  Banked with them for over 20 years, and they sure have deteriorated.  They're spending too much money pushing their brand, and not enough on providing service. Now thinking of switching banks.",1
12/14/2017 06:08:44,Daniel Walasinski,"I used to bank here in 2015. At that time they made a big mistake that I still lay for today. I had a job around the corner at the time and rather than do direct deposit I preferred to go inside to deposit my checks with the agents, that's how I always used to do it in Ohio. Everyday it seemed like they would repeat the same salesman pitches, ""hey have you heard of XYZ dah dah dah."" They would sometimes hesitate to say it because of how many times I've told them I'm uninterested. So one day I was like, ""Only if the new card is better than the one I got."" So here is when the real conartist work came into play. While talking with a banker she said that by filling out an application she can see if I'm able to get a better credit card (I was looking for lower rates just out of spite, I had a 0$ balance but was on the same card since I was 18, so perhaps we could go from 12% to 7%). A week later I get a Trio Rewards card in the mail, online my other card is cancelled. I return and say, immediately reverse what you have just done without my permission. . . So for two years I used my old platinum card, but every so often I would get hit with a $20 late payment few, I was thinking. . have I ever got those before, that's strange. . I checked and my % has also increased. . Finally while discussing the details with my agent back in Ohio he was shocked to find out that my platinum card was linked to the Trio Account which was an entirely different number and plan. . So my advice to you, get direct deposit and never go inside to do paperwork or look for something, they will bait and switch you, and not even the manager will stand behind you once you realize that you have just been scammed. It's a shame what the banking industry has become, handing out loans and money to everyone and then trying to gamble it back with fees and rates, and the poor employees trying to commission themselves to career success.",1
04/18/2018 00:21:36,Jeevan Singh,"Horrible customer service from the manager/banker. Would not reverse a fee that was a result of another tellers error that did not update our account preferences like they said they would. The banker offered to reduce ‚Äú$6‚Äù of the $36 penalty. Kind of ridiculous considering we had multiple business accounts with them for almost 4 years now. I have previous banking experience and to offer a partial waiver is hysterical and shows how much this branch cares about client retention. Certain branches are allowed a certain amount every ‚Äúperiod‚Äù to waive fees before upper management can step in to override this scenario. Closed that account on the spot and plan to switch our other businesses to another bank that is accountable with their actions. This event occurred on 4/16/18. The teller that was working was very kind, and she is honestly the only reason why I am giving a 2 star review.",2
04/14/2018 10:51:06,jack hamilton,"I stopped in to open a new checking account. I was told that I didn't qualify. I was told I should call something like quick cash or something. I wasn't going to call anybody. I always get credit card offers, loan offers etc. I went to PNC bank & opened a new checking account in 15 minutes. Save yourself a trip & go somewhere else.",1
