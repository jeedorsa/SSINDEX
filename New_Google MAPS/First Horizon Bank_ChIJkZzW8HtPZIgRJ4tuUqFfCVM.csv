04/23/2019 23:26:36,T G,"Today I went to make a deposit since I was in White House. I drive up to the window. A teller was there but she took several minutes to even acknowledge I was there.  Then she told me It would be a minute and just walked away. After A couple more minutes another teller came and said hi and took my deposit and said she would be right back. Finally the first teller came back and said "" she got you taken care of"". A 3 minute transaction took 10 minutes. This is the 2nd time, I have had a negative experience at this branch. I went in the bank last time. 2 tellers were helping one customer. They didn't even acknowledge me. My son was small and throwing a ball around. They didn't even look up, I walked out. I went to the branch in Portland. They always acknowledge you and are very nice.",1
