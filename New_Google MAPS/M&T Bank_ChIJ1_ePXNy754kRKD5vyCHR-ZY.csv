There is always attitude, or I never have ‚Äúenough proof‚Äù that it is in fact me making withdrawals and am constantly being questioned. Recently took the cake as I had to make a large withdrawal and accidentally wrote the wrong account number (I have several with M&T) The teller completely embarrassed me and announced my error in front of everyone. I will never go to this branch again.",1

05/27/2020 20:19:43,Andrew Mattei,"Not happy with peoples bank period, but this location is just as bad. I‚Äôve been a loyal customer for awhile now. Ever since they switched from Farmington savings to people‚Äôs it‚Äôs been a nightmare. I‚Äôd say 3.5 years now. I‚Äôve been dealing with an issue for a month now regarding an affidavit I had to fill out to receive a refund from a charge that was made to my account. So I filled it out & waited to hear something back, but all I received was ‚Äúohh you still have to sign the affidavit still.‚Äù Keep in mind, I‚Äôve now done this 3 times so a lack of communication with the branch seems to be a big issue here. It‚Äôs been a month & I still haven‚Äôt received my refund yet. Constant ‚ÄúOhh no worries will handle it & call you back!‚Äù & never receive a call back. Not happy at all with that‚Äôs going on & on top of most likely switching, going to have to deal with corporate to receive my money that‚Äôs OWED to me.",1

There was one banking teller on duty at the time I was going in for a transaction for 100 dollars the bank teller which was a woman teller race unimportant was very rude and told me she does not want to help me I again ask this woman teller again  are you refusing to give me service and she replied , no i will not help u at this time please use the ATM  MACHINE  IF U NEED TO GET CASH  SINCE I DIDNT GET THE CASH I WANTED I ASKED IF SHE COULD GIVE ME A  TEMP CARD  SHE REFUSED AND AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS AND NO HELP SHE THAN  TRIED to give me a card to call cooperate headquarters on her conduct SHE APPARENTLY WAS NOT PROFESSIONAL  AND did not help me and told me  am isoeaking english do u get what am i am saying  ok and i quote ""SPEAKING ENGLISH AND WHAT DONT u UNDERSTAND""  AS IF SHE WAS BUSY ALL SHE HAD tO SAY IS  i will not help you  and i would have been ok with that
I'm a customers AND customers come first AND SHOULD BE TREATED ACCORDINGLY THE BANK TELLER REFUSED  to help me,  the time was ariund 1 or 130 pm for a 20 plus year account holder I did not appreciate being treated with disrespect as this bank teller was VERY UNACCEPTABLE  BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS VERY RUDE AND UNWILLING TO HELP AND POOR AT HER JOB

All I needed was a temp card or 100 dollars transaction and she refused and was very disrespectful towards me

Awful customer service skills and I will never visit that branch again I was highly disgusted and felt very disrespected by this teller.....,,,

Retraining is a must

However, after a mix up I went into the Bristol office on Broad Street a little bit upset and concerned.  I have to recognize Ms. Joann Uribe the Vice President for her help.  She was so understanding, attentive, did everything to help me and was very professional.  A special Thank You!",5
