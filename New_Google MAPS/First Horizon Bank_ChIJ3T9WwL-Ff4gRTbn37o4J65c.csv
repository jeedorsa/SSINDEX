I've received and deposited large check amounts in this account previously and have never had a 2 WEEK HOLD PLACED ON MY ACCOUNT!!! IF I COULD RATE THIS LESS THAN ONE STAR, I WOULD!!!",1

You literally have to stand in the middle of the floor dumb founded until your able to catch eye contact with one of the ladies to be recognized. There's no ""just one moment, how are you, what do you need help with today"" or any thing. Mrs Debra Felix is the only one in the facility that has awesome customer service.",1
