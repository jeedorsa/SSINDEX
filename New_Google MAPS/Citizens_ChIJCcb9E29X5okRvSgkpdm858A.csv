06/06/2016 12:45:15,Kate M.,"I have been with Citizens Bank for almost 10 years (at various locations) and have always had a positive experience. This Manchester branch in particular has always provided excellent customer service. Last week I needed a wire transfer for my home closing and Citizens Bank came to the rescue. I was given exactly 90 minutes before my closing to wire funds to the seller's account and it needed to clear prior to the start of closing. Nick, the Branch Manager, processed it, provided me his business card in case there were any problems and stated that transfers usually post within the hour.

When I arrived at the closing my attorney informed me that 15 minutes after I had notified her that I initiated the transfer, the money had cleared. I was extremely impressed (and relieved!) - it was one less thing I had to worry about for my closing. I also noticed another woman who was at the closing; a young woman who looked extremely upset and nervous. Turns out this woman was a customer of a different local bank and had initiated her wire transfer at 9:00 am - and at 2:00 pm it still had not cleared!

The attorney looked at me and said, ""Well it looks like Citizens Bank is the place to be!"" And I sat down at the table to start my closing and thought, yup, it sure is! A big thanks to Citizens Bank for helping make my home buying process a little less stressful.",5

Although John has his mortgage at Citizens, we didn't realize we could get the very best program without any maintance fees for checking, a line of credit for overdrafts, estatements and we get free checks!! We found Nick (account manager) and Ted (bank manager) to be real people, with real hearts. They truly understand the troubles of the economy, and how hard it is to make ends meet.

What a great bank to do business with.  Check them out, and see for yourselves!",5
05/03/2018 22:20:51,Nina Baccala,"I hate most banks but these people are particularly heinous.  They don't even deserve the one star I had to give them.  They tell lies all day long.  Promised me I would have the PIN the next day and of course no PIN.  Can't tell you how many times they have made me pay 12 bucks for an overnight card that is useless because the PIN doesn't show up for another 5 days, after they lie to you and say it will be there the next day.",1

I love that they are so friendly, always make it a point to greet me, and treat me like a REAL person.....not like some of the other banks that I've been to!  Best Bank in the area, that's what I think!!!!",5
09/20/2014 18:43:45,Seth Darvick,"I have dealt with numerous banks over the past 50 years--mostly uneventful. I found myself usually taking a defensive posture on way too many occassions. I had my funds/loans etc through CBT and Bank of America. I can tell you that they pale in comparison to the Citizens bank I deal with in Manchester, CT. Their Branch Manager is an intelligent man by the name of Ted Kowaleski. It's easier to just walk in and ask for ""Ted."" He has processed and solved many problems that I deemed hopeless--I would never understand them. Ted has dealt with every issue that I brought to his desk with a smile and with an eagerness to make the client (me) happy when I walked out the door. Truly, great customer service that has gone missing from not just banks, but other businesses as well. Citizen's Bank is lucky to have a guy like this. I live in Farmington, yet drive to Manchester, bypassing a million other banks that are more convenient for traveling from my home.",4

04/11/2019 17:01:54,lissa,Horrible costumer service and very unorganized I would not recommend anyone to get this bank because your going to be jumping through a bunch of hoops to not even get done what you need too,1
