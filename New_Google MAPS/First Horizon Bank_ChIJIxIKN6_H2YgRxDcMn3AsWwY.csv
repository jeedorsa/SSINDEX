11/13/2020 19:29:59,danny lee,All I can say is I hope this close this branch ...the bankers here do not know the policy give a hard time to cash and employers check .itâ€™s a privilege to have a business accounts in your branch .respect the employee of the business account holder ..,1

Others banks like Chase,  TD Bank and Citibank do not charge you anything even if the account is closed!!! And you can do it online.

I spoke to Mrs. Melissa Karim at First  Horizon to complaint and her response was irrelevant and just it is bank policy.",2
