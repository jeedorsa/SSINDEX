Now I’m annoyed cause I submitted my documents for my name change weeks ago and still no new card or updates on the app or the emails I’m getting. Can’t call because the line is always busy. My debit card and my license don’t match. Get it together M&T, I’m sick of laughing at you since the switch from Peoples. If I don’t laugh I’ll cry haha

Update: I called the black rock branch and he gave me a new number to call to reach this branch. It was just some guy. The employee gave me the wrong number. Oh my lord, this has got to be the worst bank right?

More info because Im pissed finally found a number that works for the right branch and now I’ve been on hold for 10 minutes and counting. I had an appointment for my name change, get there and the person I have an appointment with is at lunch. The guy who put everything in says give it about two weeks. That was over a month ago Now I’m on hold because I don’t know the name of the person I spoke to… so they can’t help me? I dont know the name cause the person I was scheduled to meet, who’s name I have in writing, was MIA at our appointment time. It’s like a bank run by high school kids. Even when this gets resolved I’m still shocked by how unprofessional this bank is

As of March no changes. Come on now M&T",1

And I don't know what the lady did in the system that ended up changing my last name!! I'm so mad at this location.",1
