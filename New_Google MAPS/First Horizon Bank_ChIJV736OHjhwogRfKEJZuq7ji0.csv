03/29/2024 19:56:25,Strategic Life,"I came in with one of my employees who has been living on his own since he 11. He has tattoos and looks rough, but he‚Äôs the most honest hard worker I‚Äôve hired.  Zenaida profiled my employee, was extremely rude, combative, and was refusing to cash my employees pay check, even when he showed proper identification. I was extremely put off by this experience. And I expect that these issues won‚Äôt persist moving forward.",1
07/23/2018 17:53:20,T. Bullitt McCoun IV,I have been banking at the Downtown St. Petersburg Iberia Bank location for 3+ years. I have worked extensively with Donna Bailey who I have found to be incredibly professional and helpful to my business. She goes above and beyond to help my business and me personally with all banking matters. She does a great job and makes my banking needs easy!,5
01/23/2019 21:20:44,April Gillmore,"Normally I would never take the time to stop and leave a bank an online review, but the service I receive at this branch is nothing short of exceptional. Donna goes above and beyond to handle any support requests that I've had in a timely and professional manner. She's helpful, knowledgable and attentive. Everyone at the branch is friendly and accommodating. If you're tired of dealing with lackluster customer service from your bank, move your money here.",5
05/04/2020 05:35:33,Bush Ninja Botanicals,"NO NEW SMALL BUSINESSES! They shut you down just for asking questions. I recently opened new accounts with them. At the end of last year I formed a new business in practical herbal remedies, which is very common in this town. I inquired about how to legally interact with CBD, as there is a booming legal economy, with shops on every corner, and I was considering it. I specifically said I was NOT currently doing this, and was simply asking about how and if I could. I even said that I was happy not to if they didn't approve, my banking arrangements being more important to my business. Well after filling out the mere inquiry, I received a closure notice! Apparently even asking is enough to get you booted. We're experiencing a pandemic, and my *Wellness and Herbalism* company is totally screwed for business banking. (I wouldn't be surprised if they wanted to oust small businesses because of the virus loan situation.) My ""Relationship Banker"" and the manager were kind, but had zero say in the matter. However, I feel it was highly ignorant of them not know their corporate policy, and not to advise me against making an inquiry when I specifically express that concern in the first place.
Absolutely sucks. Totally effed.
Thanks for nothing Iberia. üòû",1
11/18/2020 21:40:41,Jas Weigt,"Free business checking, plus they give you a personal account (you don't need a prior relationship to avoid fees).  Set up was easy by appointment with Lisa, and while I wish they printed cards on site (I have to wait 7 days to get mine in the mail), so far I'm having a good experience with this bank for my new business.  If that changes, I'll update my review, but right now I'm happy with my choice.  Found them listed on NerdWallet.",5
01/20/2018 14:06:33,Jim Dietrich,"Personally, I think the chain of IberiaBank isn't half-bad, as they are a Southeast regional bank but still retain the small-bank charm that I grew up with. And honestly, most of the people in this branch (and virtually every other branch I've visited) are very nice, warm, and ready to help.

Except Donna.

She is a condescending, haughty, passive aggressive person. Every time I've come needing help, she would, in a very folksy way, basically tell me it's my fault and to suck it up. Case in point: the policy of the company is any NSF issues MUST be handled by your home branch manager, no exceptions. And another policy is, so long as you are brought positive in your account by 8pm ET, no NSF fees would hit. In fairness, I have had a history of playing close to this, but in this example, the account was brought positive by 7:30pm ET. However, the next day, I was hit with an NSF fee, and I had no money for lunch.

I called corporate, who redirected me back to this branch, and thus Donna. While I understand the policy that only the branch manager (in this case, Brian) can make this call, it's a clear mistake on part of the bank, so at some point, they should fix it. When I get in touch with Donna, she asked if I have ""peanut butter and crackers at your desk for situations like this"". She is not my mother, she is my banker, and that type of question is completely unprofessional and out of line! She then suggested, when I have money again, to get some PB and crackers ""for the next time this happens"".

Fast forward a few days, she calls me back to inform me that Brian has decided not to refund the NSF ""based on my prior history"". I'm sorry, but ""prior history"" doesn't matter when it was a bank error.

I stopped going to that branch a few years ago, long before the above example, because Donna always made me feel inferior to her, and you could tell she was being fake nice and judgemental. The people at the 34th Street branch are some of the nicest people I could ever encounter, and if you have a choice, go there‚Äîthat is, until March 29, 2018, since they're being closed by corporate. So, I'm now deciding if I continue to deal with being treated like a third-tier client or to take my business elsewhere after that date, all because of one miserable cow who doesn't know professionalism from a hole in the ground. This branch should be ashamed they still keep her around.",2
01/14/2019 15:16:34,Derek Byrne,"I cannot explain what a game changer this bank is. In the past, banking was a complete hassle, but Donna has changed that. Our law firm does all of our banking with Iberia now as a result of the service provided by the entire staff, especially Donna. I highly recommend this branch!",5
07/23/2018 18:16:01,Lisa Spencer,"I‚Äôve been banking at this location for nearly 10 years. Donna, Diane, and the entire staff have been unfailingly accommodating and kind. I feel like a million dollar customer (even though I am anything but). They provide a level of service that doesn‚Äôt seem to exist in the rest of the banking industry. I recommend them on a regular basis.",5
07/23/2018 18:06:15,sbedell,I have banked at Iberia since 2010 and everyone at the St Pete 4th St branch will go ABOVE and BEYOND to provide professional service on a personal level.  It is not like ‚Äúfactory banking‚Äù where you never see the same face twice!  Thank you Iberia Bank!,5
