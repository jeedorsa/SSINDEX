Thank you for being so very nice and respectful to All and congrats to the business. I was thinking 5 stars but when Covid hit the front doors got locked and haven't been back open. I see so many customers just try the front door & don't read sign says back door please. That's a big loss of business. If it was my Bank those doors would have been opened long ago. Thank you for the fine service to our Berclair neighborhood.",2

I was not alerted for a $1500 transfer between accounts and within one day had $105 in fees that they refuse to refund. Spent two hours with customer service between the phone and two branches everyone telling me someone else would be able to fix it.,1

Usually it take a day to deposit but now it’s taking 7….",3
12/13/2021 22:11:23,C D,One of the slowest and no caring banks. They didn't even address me after sitting there for 20 mins or more. Then they nonchalantly walk over and ask if you need help. Not a very friendly location and horribly understaffed and extremely slow. Poor management and horrible customer service.,1

09/11/2020 15:10:31,TEZ AZ,The branch manager hit at this store is not the sharpest person I do not know how he got his job or why he has this job I will never ever back with this Bank and if you are smart you would do the same they do not respect you as a customer and they do not value you as a person,1
