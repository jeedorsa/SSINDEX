Then they told me that there’s nobody available to open a safety deposit box on Saturday and therefore called on Tuesday and they also stated that nobody’s there to open a safety deposit box on Tuesday not only that I had to wait 15 minutes to be on hold just to get that answer. I had a cough three other banks in New Haven Hamden area just to get a response what kind of bake has a safety deposit box they can’t give an answer or too busy. As far as I’m concerned when I go with peoples savings bank in Southington they were awesome M&T BANK I’ll never do business with them again they seem like they’re negligent they don’t know what’s going on so I went to keystone bank never again what I keep $10 in the bank account again.
