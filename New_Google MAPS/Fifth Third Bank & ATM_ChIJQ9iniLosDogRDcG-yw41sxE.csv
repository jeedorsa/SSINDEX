He was very friendly, professional, and helpful. Walked me through the process. The next day something was wrong when I went to long into the account online. I called Victor and he took care of it right away. I was glad that he had my back. I would recommend this location.",5

I walked in last minute on Monday (2/25) to open up a FREE Personal Checking account because my Business Savings has ridiculous fees if there's no minimum amount.

Right after walking into the premises and stating that I was in a time-crunch, I was advised to WAIT until another Banker was finished with their customer by the 1st Banker who just sat there.

2nd Banker advised me that I needed to Open up an Essential Personal Checking account since I have Business Savings.  After stating my concern about the Fees, she assured me that IF I do a Direct Deposit on this account, that fee will be waived -- let's see what happens with that ~~

Desperate for some source of Funds, I presented her with a promo code that didn't work and it was 3min before closing.  Reassuring myself that I would be able to present one BEFORE the Deadline of 28th, I was presented with the 'Inconvenient Restriction' that the promo code MUST be present when the account is opened or it's INVALID.  So then I thought maybe Customer Service can do something but I was Unfortunately Informed that it's an unlikely case due to [another ridiculously inconvenient] POLICY.

However 2nd Banker was compassionate enough to inquire a workaround through Her District Manager... and calling 5/3 Customer Service and CONFIRMING that the Authority lies in where I opened my account, I called the bank again requesting assistance from the 2nd Banker.  After 1 email and being told that ""she is with a customer and call you by end of day"", it's 28th and STILL NO RESPONSE

Fortunately for the Business of 5/3 Bank, I'm FOCUSED on Priorities to continue my Purposeful Rant on this Distastefully Presented Customer Service Experience ~~
