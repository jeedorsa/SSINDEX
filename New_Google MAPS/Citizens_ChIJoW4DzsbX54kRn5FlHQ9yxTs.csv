11/11/2023 12:37:17,Cheryl Martone,I opened an account this year that was supposed to give me $300. bonus where they never did! It's get worse from there. I called the customer service line night to get help on a charge I was doing and no answer. So I pressed the fraud button to get someone on the phone and they deactivated my card which I never authorized.  No at the bank will help me with these 2 issues! I may have to close my accounts if no one takes care of the matters.,1

The lady who sits behind the desk (one of the account associates, not the counter help.) with the glasses might be the nastiest person I've ever dealt with at citizens and this is the second time I've had the same experience with her. I have been banking with them for most of my life. This experience has made me realize it's time to move my money to another bank.",1

02/06/2021 20:48:20,Ginnette Perez,By far the most uncomfortable treatment ever at any bank! I went in to withdraw money because I left my debit card. I gave the teller MaryAnn my Id and social which shouldâ€™ve been enough to pull up my account. She stated no account was under that information (never had a problem before) she profiled me for sure asking me for recent transactions my address etc making it seem like I was up to no good. Definitely very unprofessional and uncomfortable but I guess thats East Haven branch for ya!,1
