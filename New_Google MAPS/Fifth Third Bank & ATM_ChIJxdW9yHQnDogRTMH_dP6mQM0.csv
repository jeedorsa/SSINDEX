Remind you that I'm locked out !!! My pressure went through  the roof .They need a live representative  on the weekend at least until 6p or 7p because that is when people have the time to take care of there business .M-F they are working .Fact :Our money keeps them in businessright.Needless to say the emergency  funds could not be sent!! That is why I do review s to inform others .(Yes it was my fault I forgot my password )but ,if I hadn't  I wouldn't have found out about the bad customer service!!!",1

All 3 are very nice. Never had a problem with nobody. There's a Hispanic lady that works inside the bank, she sits at the end. She went out of her way as well to help me.  I have only good things to say about you guys. Thanks 5th 3rd Bank!",5

It was a horrible experience to begin with. I called this location and spoke with Marcia. The bank manager. She is amazing. She made time for me, even though I did not have an appointment at this location. She was friendly. I love that I had the horrible experience at 79th because this location is closer to home and i would have never had this pleasant experience. Thank you Marcia!",5
05/06/2021 18:03:51,Tara P,Poor couster service... third 1pm visit . Multiple people are in line but there is only one teller available. Plenty of staff milling around and meandering around but no one to help the other customer who are in line behind an apparent special needs client.,1
