As a loyal customer who values convenience, the proximity of this branch should enhance my banking experience, yet regrettably, it has been quite the opposite.My encounters with Jonathan and Jamilex have been marred by their consistently rude demeanor, compounded by their apparent disregard for professionalism. On numerous occasions, I have witnessed them engrossed in their cell phones, neglecting their responsibilities towards customers.During my first visit, I encountered Jonathan's disdainful attitude when making a cash deposit, merely because my money was folded. His curt remark about ceasing to fold money due to the inconvenience it posed to him, despite the money counter's functionality, was both unwarranted and unprofessional.Similarly, Jamilex's inability to provide assistance regarding the status of my cashier's check during another visit was met with impatience and attitude. This lack of competency coupled with rudeness only added to the frustration of the encounter.Today's visit was no exception, as I once again found myself subjected to Jamilex's impatience and condescending demeanor. Despite promptly providing all necessary documentation, her overt display of annoyance towards my perceived lack of speed was wholly unwarranted.Seeking recourse, I requested to speak with a manager, only to be met with further disappointment as I was left to wait while overhearing disparaging gossip about myself and others. This unprofessional conduct not only reflects poorly on the individuals involved but also on the bank's overall commitment to customer service excellence.Furthermore, the selective display of respect towards certain customers, coupled with the blatant disregard for confidentiality regarding personal financial matters, is deeply concerning and unacceptable. Discrimination of any form has no place in customer service, and it is disheartening to perceive such biases evident in the treatment received.In conclusion, I implore the management of 5/3 to address these systemic issues promptly. Jonathan and Jamilex's conduct is detrimental to the bank's reputation and undermines the trust and confidence of loyal customers like myself. Replacement of staff who uphold the principles of respect, professionalism, and equality is imperative to restoring the integrity of customer service at this branch.",1

I was there on Saturday trying to open a new business account and was greeted by the teller to sit down and wait. There was only one banker there. Her name is Isabel Lopez. She was with another customer so we understand the wait. However after waiting for 30 minutes she all the sudden started to help a customer that come in after us. No explanation was given until I asked why the other customer was helped first. She said it was a quick thing so she helped her first. I don’t care how quick of a request they just need to wait in line. Do you cut in line in the grocery shop just because you have less items than the person in front of you? She also told me they don’t do new account open that day. Then why would the teller greeted us and asked us to sit down and wait? This was an extremely poor experience not because I just wasted 30 minutes of my life, but also disappointed on how Fifth Third bank service their client. Fifth Third should just close this branch. It is not helping their business and reputation as a bank.",1

We rescheduled and the second time he never showed again, didn't here from him until an hour after our meeting time that he will not be making it. What kind of bank conducts this type of business where the customer can just be pushed to the side without any explanation or notice of why the customer was treated such way.  The guys name is Armando. Don't do any business with him, he is useless and will waste your time.",1

His attitude SUCKS!!  I decided to no longer come to this branch.",1

The branch on 81st and Ashland is even worst! I'm glad I only come to 5th3rd to pay my mortgage here now. I'll never open an account here again.",1

12/09/2021 20:50:26,Adi,Tellers are friendly. Super slow service due to the lack of employees every time I come they have a crowded lobby with one or two tellers.  They never answer phone calls.,1
07/22/2015 21:21:58,Luis Basto,Highly recommend . Banker Cecilia Bucio is very knowledgeable and professional with any question or issue I need to get answered. She helped me out and even prevented me from making a huge mistake that would have prevented me from obtaining a home loan . Very pleased .Thanks,5
