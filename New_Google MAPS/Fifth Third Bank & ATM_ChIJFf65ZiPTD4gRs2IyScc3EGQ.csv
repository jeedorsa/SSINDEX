03/08/2023 00:51:51,Amanda Krutsch,Someone used a clone of my debit card at this atm last night when I tried to contact the bank to get footage of the transaction to prove to my bank it wasn't me as I live in mi they refused to help me and told me they do not get involved. And wouldn't review footage without a court order? I'm baffled and appalled at the rudeness. I was not rude one bit when I called and I'm the one that is out over 200 dollars.,1
