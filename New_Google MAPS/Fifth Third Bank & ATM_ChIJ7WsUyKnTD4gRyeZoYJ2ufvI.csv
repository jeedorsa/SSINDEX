09/10/2019 18:51:43,Christine Kielbasa,"I used to go to the branch on Clybourn and Diversey to take my work deposits and my own personal banking as well.  I went to this branch on Lincoln and Irving and I felt like I was inconveniencing the teller Leticia.  I had a lot of deposits since I couldn't take them last Monday due to the holiday.  At the other branch I could have a lot of deposits and they were friendly and took care of me with no problem.  She would slap each receipt on the counter and then made a comment about how she hopes she's done by 5:00.  This was a good three hours before 5:00 so, yeah, she would be down WAY before then.  I was not very happy.  I shouldn't be made to feel bad about bringing my deposits in.",2

Thankfully, I arrived during business hours and the people there were super nice and courteous! I thought I wasted a trip to the bank, but the staff helped turned a negative experience into a positive one. Thank you!",4

Was told I cannot log in and look at any information online (I also need a checking account to be able to do that?) which I found out after being passed around to three different representatives. Tried to call my local branch to see if they can mail a couple of past statements, was told I have to go in and meet with them in person. Would have done that, but last time I was in they couldn't even find my loan information at all. I cannot wait until I no longer have to do business with them.",1
03/12/2021 23:12:39,Joe LifeLine,Just had an appointment for new account and two bankers had their masks hanging off of their ear and two tellers their mask way below their nose. It’s a shame to see they don’t take wearing masks seriously. I just left.,1
