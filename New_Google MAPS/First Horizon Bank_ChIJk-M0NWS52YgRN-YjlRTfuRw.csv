It is the worst bank by far, it is the second time I have come to this branch just because it is close to my house… to cash a check they asked me millions of totally personal and irrelevant questions. They made me wait for 1 hour for a supposed approval to collect them being issued by them. The teller, who sits at the second desk majorly (short blonde hair / 50-60 years old) made me feel uncomfortable... I consider that I take this ""verification"" only because of my skin color and I speak Spanish despite speaking to her in English.",1

The teller, the lady who sits at the second desk majorly. I can come in for a $300 withdrawal and they will immediately email and go beyond measures of this bogus
Verification process. Wouldn’t say racist, but apparently that must be the case because
I am
Black.
Lol so if you’re a person of color I’d say visiting the coral gables or Adventura branch, their always fast paced and nice",1
