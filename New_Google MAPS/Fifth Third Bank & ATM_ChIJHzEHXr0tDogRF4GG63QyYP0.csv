And they cannot assist in helping to find the thief. Because I don't have an account with them. Interesting enough I even told them the exact time the transaction was done on my card 5:15 PM",1

06/24/2019 20:34:48,Jami Stone,"This branch has perhaps the worst customer service I've ever encountered.  Specifically, Galina Goy (Assistant VP), is the most dismissive and least helpful bank employee I've encountered in quite a long time.  I visited the branch to make changes to an account.  During the 20 minutes I was there, she proceeded to tell me all about how people were quitting and didn't like working there any longer.  Once I had signed several documents to authorize changes, she tried to make the changes in the system but wasn't sure they were going through.  She assured me that she would follow up and ensure the changes were processed.  After I confirmed they were NOT processed, I called the branch a few days later and she rushed me off the phone, telling me she would call me back.  That never happened.  I then visited the branch in person again - when I walked in, she saw me and (literally) raised her hand up to 'shoo' me away, as if to say I don't have time to talk to you.  Really?  She finally made an appearance and effectively told me she didn't know how to make the changes I was requesting.  When I inquired about why she couldn't at least return my call to tell me that, her response was to tell me she was 'in a situation where she was helping customers on the line'.  I finally asked for my documents to be returned and informed her that I would be visiting another branch.  Do not bother trying to do anything in this location.",1

I had a couple hundred dollars in an account I forgot about; not only did they take all of that money in ""service fees"" but then they kept racking up the fees and wouldn't waive the $7 in overdraft.  You'd be better off keeping your money on your front lawn because at least then there is a chance it'll still be there in the morning.",1

02/17/2023 03:16:01,jamie Barrera,These lady's are not helpful and disrespectful tried to open  an account  was told they couldn't help me and when asked  why they were unable to provide any information as to why I can't open a new bank account or where I can open  a new account  this is how your employees act to customers,1
05/14/2022 18:47:06,Stephane Jean-Louis,One of the employees gave me awkward racist vibes. After one glance of me there was an automatic change of experience. Didn‚Äôt appreciate the disrespect and I sure won‚Äôt be coming back nor advocating great service.,1
03/26/2021 22:00:38,TEBarrettJr,The ladies here have always been helpful and kind.  I'm assuming the 1 stars are just salty folks trying to blame their irresponsibilities on anyone but themselves.,5
