I love their online banking. It is so easy and fast, and I really like how easy it is to replace a debit card - since I have a hard time keeping up with mine.  It's also nice that they will work with you if you overdraw every once in a decade - since I also have a hard time keeping up with my balance !",4
12/15/2023 12:03:00,Jessica White,"VERY unprofessional. received a call from one of their bankers regarding a problem with an account that I share with a family member. my account was frozen without my knowledge and when I tried to share that it upset me a little that I was not informed, I was belittled. I was told that I was a ‚Äúbig girl‚Äù now, and that I didn‚Äôt need to be sharing an account with that family member anymore. Banker was very rude and stated that they didn‚Äôt care if I closed my accounts- and I never even threatened to. I never said one rude word to this man, but he was unkind and cold with me. I genuinely can‚Äôt believe that they are allowed to speak to you in that manner. Not even McDonald‚Äôs would tolerate their employees speaking to you in the way that he spoke to me. I‚Äôm actually considering closing my accounts now since he mentioned it. It would save me from being at risk of receiving the same treatment in the future. I‚Äôd leave 0 stars if I could.",1

First Tn fraud dept caught it immediately before anything shipped. Sooooooo thankful. I've been a First Tennessee customer since 1978 and will continue to be!!",5
