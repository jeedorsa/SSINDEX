Lynn and Maria both spent time with us to make sure that all the paperwork was submitted and that we understood the process. In addition to being so helpful, they were always very pleasant and glad to see us. We appreciate having a local bank that knows us and cares about our needs. Thank you!",5

There is one gal at the Cromwell branch on Shunpike Road in the K Mart Plaza who can set up an account for you, Her name is Paula. Go see her. Top Notch, Professional, and will be on your side.",5
