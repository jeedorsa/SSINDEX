Welcomed me when I arrived along with apologizing for the wait. They worked well together trying to assist customer ahead of me. Wonderful teamwork, with smiles on their faces. Great customer service",5

Never had any real problems to speak of other than they had some account representatives through the years that were shaky at best, but overall, ok.  My mother in law recently passed away and my wife became the executer of her estate. She needed to close my mother in law's bank account since my mother in law had already moved to Florida and there were no Citizens there anymore. When my wife went to close the account, they ask her for paperwork from the estate showing she was authorized to do so. She gave them the paperwork she was given from the estate attorney, but they said they needed paperwork direct from the judge stating she was the executer. My wife requested paperwork from the courts of Florida and brought them to Citizens which she was then told that she needed to get them Notarized. My wife asked if they could Notarize the document there and Israel Velez, Branch Manager, said they had no notary there so she had to travel to another Bank and had them Notarized. She then went back to Citizens and Israel Velez, Branch Manager, stated that the paperwork needed to have a raised seal from the Notary or it was not valid in CT. She traveled back to the other bank that notarized the documents and was told that they did not have one and that a raised seal was no longer required in the state of Ct! She went back to Citizen's and explained to Israel Velez, Branch Manager, how a seal was not required and he then argued with my wife for a moment before saying it was Citizen's policy anyway! Wait, Notaries no longer are required to use raised seals but this guy wants my wife to produce one where there is none LEGALLY required or available! My wife, now very aggravated,  said she didn't understand why she was having such a big problem closing her deceased mother's account with all the proper paperwork and as the legal executer . She then mentioned that we never had any problems doing business with Citizens when Caesar Abreu was the manager and his response to her was ""maybe she should go find Caesar and do business with him!!"" Wow! That's Super professional! Mind you this is just to close an account legally, with a measly $95 dollars left in it for my mother in law who past!  Then after arguing back n forth with my wife, he said he would have to submit it to their legal dept! Really?? What good is it having a branch Manager who has no ability to make decisions, and is super arrogant on top of it?! Remember....we are trying to close an account LEGALLY with only $95.00 in it for someone who has passed away!  Needless to say, when my wife told me of this man's arrogance, I went back to the bank and closed our account! Over 30 years of business with them and that man destroyed our relationship in minutes...What happened to customer support? I would NEVER do business with them again! Mind you, we still have not heard anything from their legal dept and we are approaching a month already.  Its bad enough we are all still mourning over the loss of my mother in law, this Bank and its manager are preventing us from closure.. Very Sad......",1
11/21/2018 19:55:56,Stephanie Fragosa,Went to the branch today “Caesar” told me I could not pay my sisters loan! Since when does a bank say they don’t want your money!! A day before thanksgiving and he made life a living nightmare! Sent us from North Haven to Orange! Like since when does someone tell you to spend your money elsewhere! Citizen Bank look really closey at your staff and wonder why the branch is empty!!! There was literally not one other soul in the branch! The employees like Caesar make customers go to Bank of America!!!!!,1
