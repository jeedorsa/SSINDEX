I had to wait a very long time for something simple because the system crashed and was not working. Another time, the teller was left on hold for 20 minutes. They also don’t have temporary cards. The staff is nice, the company is not.",3

I was yelled at something that I do not know and was an honest mistake which I forgot and clearly owned up that it was a mistake from my part, then the rude and threatening words comes firing towards me and left me baffled and shell shocked. Why am I getting treated so bad where I give them a business. It was not the first time that has happened to us in this branch... we have had few similar bad experiences in this branch. Therefore it is not the bank, it is people who works there. I am starting to think maybe because of my color or the way I look.",1

12/29/2020 15:40:56,Bill From Easton,"Digital platforms ie website and apps are circa 1990, and international support for basics like ATM withdrawals overseas are ridiculously complex. Fraud detection service is severely flawed re-triggering freezes and denials for even monthly repeat charges at established companies. Then there’s their Horrid customer service staffing levels (extreme wait times), response times, service levels - even for “premier” account holders with 30+ years relationship.",1

Ridiculous fees  and that were not properly explained when I opened the account two months ago. Rude and unhelpful,c service representatives . As soon as my bills that I paid go through, I am leaving and taking my money somewhere else.",1

10/10/2020 16:42:22,Milvio Deleon,Employees are more worried about getting out of work on time than helping customers. Citing bank rules that do not exist. Pathetic customer service time and time again. I will be taking my business somewhere else.,1
