I was second in line, while one was counting the till the other 3 girls were talking behind the registers knowingly there's at least 10 people in line. This is not the first time they only have 1 teller working. Very Lazy ðŸ˜’",1
06/01/2023 14:32:31,Kevin Carroll,I have been banking at this branch for years.  I have always found the tellers and manager to be very friendly.  Monica the current manager is the best since Angela was there   This branch can get very very busy compared to many other branches and the tellers all seem to handle the crowds amazingly,5
07/20/2022 21:05:35,Blonde Shell,"Iâ€™ve been banking with this bank for years and I stop in the hartford location inside of stop and shop. I stop in for quarters and was waited on by Jezebel. When I got home and counted my quarters, they were short I contacted the branch to advise the women of this matter. She stated she would count her draw and call me back. I never received a call back so I made an follow up call. Jezebel did advise me they drawer was off. She never offered to returne the difference in the cash. She made a comment that she was just trying to accommodate me which is a lil offensive when I came in for a service as a customer. Never apologize and got very defensive when I asked for the branch manager.",1
