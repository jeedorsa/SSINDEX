Said Manager then asked me if I was a bank member. The relavancy of this question defies logic. I responded in the affirmative and then proceeded and interracted with the teller. However, I would be remiss if I did not convey my disappointment in the lack of professionalism exhibited by the manager. This reflects poorly on Fifth Third Bank.",1

Yes, I know I could deposit them via my phone - but I enjoy the friendly human interaction and Natasa is one of the most pleasant tellers I’ve ever met. She’s been very helpful in updating details in my account as well.",5
