I'd highly recommend doing business with this bank, if anyone for any reason had a bad experience I don't know what to tell you, it's not the bank, it's you.",5

Mary, the notary, has attempted to ""pitch"" their services and upsell, when all I want is for she to notarize documents. Nothing else. Too much hard upselling when one has already received poor service is a real turn off, Mary.",1
