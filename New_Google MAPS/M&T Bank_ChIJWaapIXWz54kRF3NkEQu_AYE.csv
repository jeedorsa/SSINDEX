05/11/2023 03:04:44,Heather Jubb,"Went to the bank this morning before work and arrived around 10:10am. There was a single car at the drive in, so we pulled behind, thinking it’d be quicker than going inside. BIG mistake. After about a min the car leaves and we pull up. We’re waiting a solid 5 mins before someone even comes to the window. There’s literally 4 tellers and 1 customer. After hitting the call button twice, someone finally comes and just opens the drawer, my husband grabs a slip and she closes the drawer, doesn’t say anything, and  just walks away. So I fill out the slip and wait. And wait. And wait. Mind you, ONE customer. We hit the call button and nothing. So, I honked the horn, which I generally would NEVER do. However, it’s been close to 10 mins since getting the slip and I have to drive to Hartford to go to work. The teller helping the only customer turns around and continues to YELL that I’m the next in line, that they’re busy, (but they’re not!) and it’s extremely disrespectful that I honked. Then says I won’t be helped and can go to a different branch! All I needed was a simple withdrawal. I know I shouldn’t have honked, but she seriously overreacted. I am still a customer, not her child, and she was being FARRR more disrespectful by yelling at me. Anyway, we left (at 10:25). She was probably in her early 30s, hispanic, and had dark hair. This is just a savings account that I have here. However, I think I’ll take my business elsewhere and close the account. The whole thing left a terrible taste in my mouth and I wish I had gotten her name. I’ve worked in customer service for the past 17 years and would NEVER treat a customer in such a disgusting and disgraceful manner! Shame on you! Do yourself a favor and don’t bank here, or at least not at this branch!",1

03/05/2021 15:45:18,Monique McDonald,"I have to come here for work, this is not my bank of choice. These girls make the biggest deal about calling before picking up change. I called an hour ahead and had to wait 10 minutes in line just to hear they haven’t even begun to put it together. Let’s see how much longer it will take 😡😡😡😡",1
