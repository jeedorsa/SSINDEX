Monir Biplob was in charge of our mortgage loan and was a terrible communicator. At one point, he left town for 6 days in the middle of our mortgage processing without saying a word or responding to our dozens of emergency texts, emails, and phone calls when we had an actual banking emergency that could effect our loan. When he got back to town, he said he had his laptop with him the whole time (so he was basically just ignoring us and leaving us to panic.) He didn't answer half of our questions on any given day, he dropped the ball on a lot of forms, and was clear as mud on what we should do next at every point of the process. He ADDED so much stress to an already stressful process. And they're still catching his mistakes and changing our mortgage amount even after the closing.  Save yourself the stress and use literally ANY other bank for your loan. We will be closing all other accounts with M&T now that the house loan has closed.",1
