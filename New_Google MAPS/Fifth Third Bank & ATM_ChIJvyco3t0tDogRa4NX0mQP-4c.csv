She was very nice, polite, and helpful and helped me choose the right CD for my budget. This was a very clean and organized branch and highly recommended for banking services",5
12/07/2023 23:33:57,Marko Loncar,This branch sucks! The neighborhood must be so good that they closed the vestibule to the ATM that says 24 hours at 5:25 instead of the sign on the door that says 5:30! One of the reason why I should leave 5:30,1
09/13/2023 21:32:43,Maria R,Never come here after 4:30pm when they are closing. There are 4 people here ready to leave and the young girl with the curly hair at the counter said she’s leaving and I need to see a banker instead. Always spending longer here than at other banks.,1

I started calling September 3 of 21 about this issue bills that were supposed to be paid we’re not, and the bills that were not supposed to be paid were paid. I was told by my banker that I would have my money put back in my account September. He’s been dodging me they have not put the money back into my account I did not make the errors and The bank has been very uncooperative as far as refunding my money back into my account. They want me to reach out to the utility companies when the bank made a mistake and I want my money back I’ve been lying to me the entire month today is 30 September and I still have not got satisfaction. I am a 70 year old disabled senior citizen and don’t have any money to give to the utility companies or to the bank. And I do not like the way through respond to this issue.",1
03/23/2021 17:57:02,Dhinesh B,I visited this branch last year to open a account. They staff members are so kind enough to walk though the list of plans also given good offer when opening the account. They also did follow up call for any question and helped to set up mobile banking as well. During the covid I got call and enquired about my well being. The customer service of this branch is totally awesome.,5
