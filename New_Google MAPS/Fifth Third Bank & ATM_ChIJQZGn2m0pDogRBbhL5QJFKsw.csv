04/02/2024 22:39:06,Thomas Matt,No ATMs available after hours. I arrived 7 mins after closing and the bank was still full of employees and they wouldn't open the vestibule to let me use the ATM.,1
03/29/2024 01:46:37,SARV SINGH,I have been going to this branch for last 5 years and almost never had been disappointed or spent hours there.,5
10/16/2021 21:29:47,Paris Finley,"This review is from my experience last week. After seeing reviews of the service in the past, I was relieved I didn't have to go in (or so I thought). My card was no longer working properly and the ATM held my card for security reasons and directed me to a teller. I was immediately greeted by Ricky Diaz and told him of my problem. He explained why the ATM held my card and that it will dispense it to them in about 45 minutes and I could wait or leave and he could call to let me know. I selected the latter, made a quick deposit and went home. Sure enough within the hour as promised, Ricky called and informed me my card was ready. Because my card was worn out, I no longer wanted it so we ordered a new replacement card and everything went smoothly. I would like to give a big Kudos to Ricky and to whomever made the changes to that branch. I had never been to that 5/3rd location and after seeing the reviews, I can only say they were taken seriously because that was not the experience I had. Great job guys!",5
08/11/2021 19:28:27,Dontel Roberson,This bank does not have enough coverage or employees to support the business… the tellers all have a attitude. They really hate their jobs and don’t like working for the company and you can actually tell. Customers service is trash … you’ll be better off going to a whole other bank.,1
07/17/2019 14:19:21,Jane Han,"I agree that this is the most unprofessional bank location. Bankers and tellers are completely incompetent and unprofessional. I dropped by the location during lunch time to transfer my deposit from CD to a checking account. A banker struggled to do the job. She called here and there to figure out how to do it. Forty minutes later, she said she did wrong and should start the process all over again.  I couldn't wait any longer because my lunch break was over. She said that I could leave and she will take care of the rest of process and call me in a 30 min. But I did not get her call even after four hours.  When I called her using the number on her business card, nobody answered.  People are so irresponsible and unprofessional in this place.",1
07/10/2020 20:11:19,Mechelle Wiley,They is very unprofessional in this place. I deposited a larger amount money order and cash they money was deposited and someone took the money out before out the account. I also had a teller to question me about my account why I'm depositing so much money in my account the teller Sharonda is very unprofessional she was sharing my account info to the other teller why she was waiting on  someone else they need to do something about this branch and worker at this branch because there are to many complaints on this branch  nothing done about it and no good management there  if was we wouldn't have these many problems.,1
01/24/2019 23:06:36,zakeia hampton,"This has to be the most unprofessional bank location that I’ve ever been to.  The staff are completely incompetent The tellers are always very unprofessional, and hold side conversations while taking care of bank customers. The security guards hold loud and distracting  conversations and are easily distracted themselves. This is quite concerning because the security is supposed to keep the bank and it’s customers safe. I live a block away but will travel downtown to a more safe and professional location.",1
05/29/2017 14:02:19,Crown Prince Productions,"May 26, 2017, (I wish I could post with no stars) My spouse and I entered the branch. Very happy and giddy. We were seen by Shanel Tolbert, whom in the past has had a very poor attitude and suspect customer service. My spouse and I were depositing 10 checks in 5 different accounts. Since we'd had issues with major deposit errors in the past with this particular branch and the downtown Clark street branch, I said to my spouse in a very soft way ""Let's deposit checks for one account at a time so we won't have any mistakes"" Immediately Shanel looked up and said with a horrible attitude ""I don't make mistakes"" with a smile, because I was never speaking directly to her, I said, the mistake happened here. She continued to speak with negativity and poor tone and replied, ""Well it wasn't me"" I replied with laughter ""It really doesn't matter who it was it was a fifth third issue so I just want to be sure because it's a holiday weekend"" She proceeded to toss my receipts and when I asked for balances on all accounts, she only gave me 4. So I asked again for my 5th balance, and she looked over me to my husband and said ""do you want a balance"" I said ""these are our accounts, did you hear what I asked, is there a problem"" She threw the receipt, refused to complete the transaction and when a nice, well mannered teller tried to complete the transaction she told him not to touch her drawer. I spoke to the manager Jeff, sent an email to the regional manager as well as the corporate offices. I feel that she doesn't need to represent fifth third bank as a brand. As a former teller myself, customer service is non negotiable. Her attitude was inappropriate and highly unprofessional.",1
06/30/2022 15:00:31,Elizabeth Love,I went there to set up an estate account and everyone was friendly and knowledgeable.  The set up was easy.  Every visit if quick and the staff are very welcoming.,5

06/14/2017 23:22:22,Kevin Rogacki,"DO NOT GO HERE: THEY WILL GIVE YOU A $140 PARKING TICKET

Parked in the parking lot to buy Subway and went across the street to the currency exchange. When I came back (after less than 5 min) from the currency exchange a private company called Innovative Parking Solutions LLC had placed a boot on my car and told me to pay $140 to have it released. I believe the companies in this parking lot and Innovative Parking Solutions are in a profit sharing scheme to swindle consumers out of a decent chunck of change. Otherwise, why not have parking meters/pay to park like most other private parking lots?

I can't believe the City of Chicago permits this kind of private parking company to boot peoples' private property (their cars)!",1
