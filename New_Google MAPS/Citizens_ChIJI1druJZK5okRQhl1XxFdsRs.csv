01/14/2019 14:07:30,Randy,Never use mobile banking on a Saturday. And if you are going to ASK THEM TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING IN DETAIL like depositing a check through mobile banking on a Saturday and not having access to your funds til effn Tuesday. And then if you think some supervisor or higher up can help? Forget it they can't as they are limited to the levels of a bank teller. Ridiculous. I learned my lesson. Never using that system again,1

01/18/2018 22:06:21,Elisabeth Davis,"Having moved from Florida and opening up an account with this bank today (01/18/2018$, I have to say, I'm impressed. Back in FL, to open up an accnt, they ask for a lot of unnecessary information to do so. Not this bank. The process was easy and the staff were very professional and genuinely nice. So far, so good. I definitely recommend this bank.",5
