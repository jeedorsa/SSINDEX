I have a huge business account with 5/3 and use this branch for my deposits (which are always larger than a few thousand dollars) specifically because they‚Äôre supposed to have a drive through open until 5:30pm on weekdays according to their official website. Any time I come by around 5:15pm I am told that they are closed by one specific representative, who is obviously just too lazy to do their job. I will be closing my account with 5/3 specifically because of my experience with this branch and will make sure to file a complaint with the corporate. Hopefully, they take their customer service more seriously than the employees they hire to represent their company at local branches.",1
12/29/2023 16:35:47,Travera Smith,The service is horrible the staff is more nosey with what‚Äôs going on outside than doing their jobs with customers right in front of them and then what‚Äôs the point in an drive thru atm when their is a window right before it and they handle hour long transactions at this window so your wait is forever to use the outside atm to not be bothered with inside staff,1

07/09/2023 05:01:28,Benjamin Standish,"This Branch Of Fifth Third bank in Pilsen is an absolute joke. Every time l have been there it is a complete disaster.
Nobody there know what they're doing, especially the account managers an hispanic gentlemen.
And beware these people here are completely racist. I had a black friend with me who tried to open an account there, And they won't give him the time of day.
They should be ashamed of themselves. THIS BRANCH IS A DISCRACE.",1

She didn‚Äôt even bother smiling and told me the document I am asking for is not available until I told her phone customer service told me otherwise!!
Never going to this branch again!",1

05/26/2020 19:14:02,Stafford Garrett,"I have been a Fifth Third customer for over 20 years. Paying  monthly fees as an account holder. The pandemic has caused many discomforts to us all; however, the customer service and authority should have a little more compassion. Speaking specifically of Manager Ms. Gomez. Last month I was denied the right to withdraw money from my debit card Netspend/SSI. I was told by one of the employees that the machine was down. Ms. Gomez thereafter came to the phone and confirmed the employees statement. Today I was told by Ms. Gomez that I would have to make an appointment. First of all, other Fifth Third branches have 1625 W. 18th St. Chicago Illinois 60608 as the bank to do business via drive thru/window. Ms. Gomez ask me what kinda card did I have. This entails discrimination. It should not matter what kinda card I have. Either you do the transaction or you don't . This is in violation of the ADA. Americans with disability act. This is also racial discrimination and racial profiling. Ms. Gomez felt adamant about her position and confident in what she was saying. This is also a predominant Hispanic area. I will also request a reimbursement for the last to months for denied services. I will also complain via other sites and the corporate in this matter. finally, I told Ms. Gomez my intent. Giving her plenty opportunity to make it right. This is something she felt confident and content in doing. So lets see how it works for you Ms. Gomez.Thank you for reading. Have a great day.",1

C√≥mo a cambiado este banco‚ÄºÔ∏è
Antes uno llamaba a este n√∫mero y contestaba alguien exactamente en este banco pero ahora uno llama toda la semana y NUNCA DE LO NUNCA CONTESTAN, que porque est√°n ocupados y yo he ido a cualquier hora ah√≠ y est√°n pl√°tica y pl√°tica.
Y igual que cuando haces una cita, atienden cuando se les da la gana que disque porque el sistema ""se call√≥"".
Estoy pensando seriamente cambiar de banco porque ped√≠ una nueva tarjetas de cr√©dito, ya casi van para 2 meses y TODAV√çA NO LA ENV√çAN por correo.
