10/16/2023 15:27:33,Mack L,Definitely the worst First Horizon branch I’ve been too. I’ve had a business account for almost 2 years and this branch wouldn’t accept a Passport as identification. They said only a drivers license is valid and the manager wouldn’t even close my account without me providing a drivers license instead of passport. I called customer service and they flat out said the branch was wrong… went to another branch and no issue.,1

This one CSR I encountered didn’t understand my problem I was having with my account,  she told me “ you figure it out” Im gonna refer to her has “Keisha” oh Keisha at some point in the conversation told me “ you figure it out” and dismissed me from her desk and as I turned to Leave, was saying stuff under her breath. I ask to speak to the manager, who later came from lunch. “Keisha” went to brief the manager before I spoke with her . I spoke with the manager who did nothing in my opinion but pacified me right out the door. Oh Keisha didn’t even show any interest or concern for my problem and me as a customer.  Even though this branch is closer, I drive to the other side of town for customer service , it’s worth the drive.
. A half of star for opening the building!",1
