Called the branch and was informed that the ATM would not be serviced until the next Wednesday. This is banking is 5/3 worse. Unacceptable",1

07/05/2019 17:33:21,Sonja D. Bell,I ordered a replacement debit card for remote access to my account and had it mailed to this particular location. When received the available bank associate allegedly activated the card and assigned a 4-digit pin for access. Upon attempting to use the card at a store and on the 5th 3rd app I was denied access and received an error message stating the card could not be activated so I've been unable to add/change the pin # or use said chip card for purchases or to log on to the app which should also recognize my assigned user id,3
08/05/2018 19:38:42,Facebook,"This is my first offer from 53 Trio credit card in mail with pre approved for everything. I applied and got the card. In order to activate the card, I went online but that did not work then I called the number. They asked me few questions and finally they flagged potential fraud and asked me to go to branch to verify. I do not drive and work M-F 9-5ish, so my husband drove me to 53 branch on Saturday. Personnel there transfer us to see 3 different employees and finally last one was the right one. He asked for credit card number, current address, social security, occupation and drivers license number entered in 53 database and then called fraud detection department. Unfortunately, they also work at the same time as rest of the world works. But he told me do not worry you can call them on Monday. I entered some crucial information and once they see that I entered all information they can understand they went to branch and will activate your card. I called them on Monday and they clearly said you have to go to branch again and only  M-F 9-6*. Now I have to take PTO just to activate this card :) OR most probably I will just keep it somewhere safe. I hope fraud department works 1 less hour on week days and work on Saturday for few hours OR they have ability to make some online notes where branch employees can verify themselves and enter notes for corporate (this is very easy/cheap in terms of IT and implementation).",2

08/15/2018 18:28:57,Robert S.,5/3 Bank the only bank that are happy that you close your account because they know that they are robbing you but are told by supervisors to not waive fees. Who charges a fee to replace a lost debit card?!,1

Larkin in Elgin,IL.  Becky Torres the branch manager there values her customers.",2
