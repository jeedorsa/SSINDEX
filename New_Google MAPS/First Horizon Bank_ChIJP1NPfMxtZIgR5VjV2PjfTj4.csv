02/27/2024 16:38:13,Patsy chance,"Drive thru takes FOREVER. Most of the time the teller doesn‚Äôt even acknowledge me once I do pull up. It‚Äôs so sad because this location use to be EXTREMELY friendly and you were in and out of the drive-through in three minutes or less. They are obviously having a huge staffing issue, but the staff that they do hire should be friendly. The lady today did at least speak to me, but I come to this location at least three times weekly. Last week they were extremely rude every single time . It still took at least 15 minutes today with one car in front of me.",1
10/10/2023 18:03:43,Loungewear Lowkey,A few nice tellers. I've had several encounters with the not so professional ones. Drive thru takes 20 minutes minimum.. and that's when I'm the only car in the parking lot.,1
04/03/2024 16:57:29,golian gadalseed,"The laziest bank I been in.
Every time I go to make a transaction they tell me to go to another branch.
That happened 3 times in a row.",1
03/11/2023 16:28:54,King's Alabaster Oil,"I Love This Bank! I Opened my accts, during a Rain Storm, My Wheel Chair Went rolling Down the parking lot & It Was a Mess, Soaked Went & The Customer service was Amazing! The Gentleman came running to the door to let me in..Which Was Very Sweet..",5
08/21/2023 23:41:22,paul dodds,"2 for 2 Fail! Need to deposit a paycheck, La vergne Location unavailable, tried here, same thing.  50/50 crapshoot whether ATM is operational, just like berry hill location.  This bank must really only function as a debt generator.",1
08/08/2018 21:56:32,Jenny Revord,The institution is fine but this branch SUCKS. I've waited in the lobby over 20 min to get assisted. Nothing. I'll sit in the drive thru for 15-20 min just trying to deposit cash. The ATM doesn't work. I've called in and waited forever for someone to take my call. It seems they don't have enough staff or the staff they do have don't have a clue what speed and efficiency is. As a bank they're fine but as a specific branch they need better management or the ability to hire more staff. No one should have to wait more than a few minutes on a deposit. I've sat in my car for almost 30 min waiting on a receipt. That is unacceptable.,1
04/14/2022 18:47:21,Zoom Baby,"They are so horrible when it comes to communication. I took off work to come here to open a business account. Got here at 10 something , one banker is already on break. HOW??? Then come back at the time they say and he tell me I have to come back at 3:30. Cool but because I‚Äôm opening a business account I have to come back tomorrow cause they close at 4. TF I WORK TOMORROW. He didn‚Äôt even try to accommodate my time off, worst bank EVER . If I could give them ZERO STARS I WOULD !!!",1
11/06/2021 17:11:35,t Totally,If give them a zero if icould. Worst customer service.  I come inside to be waited on.  Someone is in front of me.  The woman said there's a wait. I wait  and wait and wait and she continues to take drive through peeps.  Ignores me.  I'm fed up after 20 mins and left.  I'll remove my business and not be back,1
07/29/2017 02:22:30,Knuckle Duster,"I had an unexpected financial emergency and needed to get a cash advance from my credit card. I called another bank and the person actually hung up on me.
So, I went to First Tennessee.
Dawn was awesome! She was friendly, helpful and completed my transaction. I bank at another institution but after this experience, I will be reconsidering my banking options.",5
01/03/2020 16:26:15,talent powell,"been with First Tennessee several years, since it switched to First Horizon I've had nothing but problems, the mobile app isnt accurate anymore, theres always an issue with the ATM, my card is declined at several locations, I cant make online purchases or payments , my account was emptied by an outside party and took 4 days to get the money back in the account. This bank is becoming more of an issue than a convenience. closing my account this week.",1
04/29/2017 18:58:39,"Ronald Carson,SR.","FTB has been our bank for several years and we have received the best service ever. We have owned businesses and have banked with  3 other banks some giving bad service and others simply being there but not really trying to take good care of us.

Because of a friends recommendation we visited FTB and have been elated with their service but even more so with their employees. Marcus Haley has been taking wonderful care of us for many years now and is the best banking representative we have had the pleasure of working with. His big smile and positive attitude makes banking easy and enjoyable.

Jennifer Byrd in financial services is equally good.

This branch is the very best we have experienced while banking in Nashville.

06/26/2018 02:05:47,meli espinosa,I was assisted by an old guy and he wouldn't let me cash the check becuase my fathers signature is required (which has never been problem since I am in the account) I went back home and got it signed b/c he was. Not able to go cash it unless it had my fathers signature (although I am on the account) and I am also in the account as well. ! again I repeat! After that I was then assisted by this black lady with some ugly ass weave and yellowish hair and she ddnt even ask for my account number she just said she couldn't.she refused to do it knowing I was also on the account. WHY DO THEY HIRE PEOPLE LIKE THAT? ITS RIDICULOUS IF U HAVE AN ACCOUNT WITH THEIR BANK U ARE SUPPOSE TO BE ABLE TO CASH AND DEPOIST . I went off on her and snatched the checks and slammed the door. This place is a joke .,1
02/17/2020 18:47:03,Beverly Partain,"Member of this bank 20 yrs. Money was stolen from my account through overdraft fees, money has been returned, looking for new bank anyway since I moved 200 miles.",1
04/20/2017 18:54:46,Keith Yancy,I have been with several banks over the years but this is best bank by far I have ever banked with. They have been by my side through the good times and hard times for over a year now. Thanks First Tennessee for making me family.ü§ó,5

04/25/2018 16:51:08,LMO !,Terrible service. It took 30 minutes to cash a check. 2/3 workers were working and the other was just staring not doing anithing. Worst visit ever! This place is a joke.,1
07/01/2018 08:53:29,Flex Fanatic,Do not try to put money in the ATM if the light is red it took all of our money and didn't give it back and told me the transaction was cancelled I'm going to have to wait till Monday to get any money back or to even dispute this but it's still insane that an ATM won't give my money back,1
