09/24/2023 18:34:26,E Hegedus,Peoples was a great bank for over 70 years! Since M&T took over it has gone down hill. Open hours are fewer. Branches are fewer. CD rates too low. No more copies of cancelled checks. What will become of this?,1

And this woman lists herself as the branch manager. I can't speak for M&T bank as a whole, but if Rose is employed permanently at the Fairfield branch, avoid it at all cost.",1
