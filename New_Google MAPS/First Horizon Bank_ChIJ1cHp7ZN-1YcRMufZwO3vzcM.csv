03/25/2024 13:32:44,Gabriel Villasmil,"This has been literally the best experience I have had with regard to establishing a loan.  We felt that while we had to submit plenty of documents, we only had to do it once. The process was very smooth for us.  Drew was also there and available throughout to help us with our questions/concerns.  I definitely recommend Drew and First Horizon to my friends.",5

11/19/2023 15:59:08,Tom Nugent,"Mr. Hal Golden and Ms. Jennifer are a great team. This is the second time they have helped us obtain loan for our investment property. They are super nice and easy to talk to when we have questions concerning the high interest rates. Mr. Golden took the time to explain the different options available and provided in writing, for comparison, which was super easy to understand. Ms. Jennifer's meticulous attention to detail and prompt communication kept everything on track. The online portal to upload requested documents was similarly super easy to use. Overall, we are very satisfied with the loan process and would definitely use them again in the future, if the need arises. Thank you Mr. Golden and Ms. Jennifer for your help.",5

Do not hesitate to hire this team as your lender. They are communicative, efficient, transparent, knowledgeable advocates! Brick was responsive from the get-go, literally emailed me back within minutes, and persisted throughout. I am grateful that he was able to walk me through the doctor loan process and helped me get to the finish line with as much money back as I could receive! The loan was ready to close early, and we were able to close on the home earlier than anticipated, even before 30 days!! Not only did their team communicate well with me, they coordinated with my realtor and the closing attorney and included me on the emails. This made it easy for me to know where I was at in the process at all times. I will use this team specifically 100x over and over, because I’ve never had this great of an experience with a lender the other times I’ve purchased a home! They are truly the BEST of the best!",5

01/15/2024 11:36:39,Sherry Folse,"For me, the question is not why choose Nason Williams as your loan officer. The question is why choose anyone else.

Why is this location and many others rated so highly. Versus the branch off Forest Hill and Winchester.  How is it that certain locations get rave reviews and others are panned.  If you can go to this location or others do so  don’t go to forest hill in Germantown.  You’ll regret it",1

09/16/2022 09:59:46,Amy Major,"Paul Weeks and everyone at First Horizon were incredible. When at first we thought we didn’t even qualify for a loan, Paul did research and gave us options and next steps. When we came back ready to buy a home, he got everything ready for us within 24 hours for preapproval! By the time we closed, we were able to get more loan money and pay less for closing than we originally even thought. He went above and beyond, was super helpful and willing to answer any question.

07/10/2022 00:52:50,Dave Moore,"Justin was fantastic to work with.  This is the second mortgage I have financed through First Horizon, and this one was much easier to manage because Justin was on top of everything from the beginning.  He had everything handled with the underwriter, the real estate attorney, and the insurance company with minimal input needed from me.  I would love to work with him again, and I will highly recommend First Horizon mortgage services based off of my experience with Justin.  I have many services through First Horizon, and this experience with Justin was the best.  He never pushed me off onto his assistant (like the wealth management guys do), and he ALWAYS returned my calls, texts, or emails in person. This has not been my experience with First Horizon in the past, and I hope they are turning over a new leaf.  I often get excuses about how busy they are or how they have a new assistant, but with Justin I just got answers and never a single complaint.  I can't say enough about how nice it was to work with a professional who cares about the customer.  Thanks Justin!",5

I have had multiple instances where I was unable to access the money in my account due to technical challenges on their end, the mobile app is buggy, have had difficult times trying to contact people by phone, and was talked out of trying to take out an auto loan many years ago... not denied, mind you, but strongly suggested to not pursue it, despite having okay credit.
