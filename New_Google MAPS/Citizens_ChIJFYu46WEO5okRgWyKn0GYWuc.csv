The relationship banker, Samantha Poulicakos, went above and beyond to assist us with closing and opening accounts for our deceased father.  She did more than she was required and even helped us with another account at a different bank.  She was in no hurry, she was friendly, sympathetic and knowledgeable.  We know God sent us to the right branch.  In my opinion, her title describes her perfectly.  It was like we've known her for years.  She deserves more than 5 stars.",5
