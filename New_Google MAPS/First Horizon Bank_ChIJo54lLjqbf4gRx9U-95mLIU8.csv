I came in at 8.30 to get a stamp for some stock documents.  The manager that handles this was already late coming in, and one of the employees said he would be right with me. Well 20 minutes later I was told he had a meeting and I would have to come back another day.  Went to Germantown location and they asked if it was Nathan and I said yes, and apologized and handled it within 10 minutes and said meeting or not I should have been taken care of. You should be at the bank and ready to go before the doors open.  I can definitely see why they have such Terrible reviews.",1

After receiving my envelope as usual I counted my money then realized I did not have the change from the transaction.  I called back to inform the teller, and she replied, “Sorry, I forgot. Send the tube back.”   I sent the tube back and received it back with change, emptied it and drove off.  When I got home discovered she had not given me the right change, not $.72, but $.58.   The amount of money was insignificant, but it did make me question the efficiency and/or honesty of the teller.",1

Every employee will glare at you the moment you walk through the door and they all have such a NASTY attitude and act like it’s all cute to be ugly towards people! Absolutely sickening, so I am DONE with this bank PERIOD!",1
11/03/2021 15:55:03,Natural Remediez,I absolutely have a great customer service experience everytime I come to this branch. I actually pass by the one near Winchester and Kirby to come to this one.  Today Egor helped me I had several transactions I needed and he made me feel welcome and certain that he would take care of them and he did...you guys keep up the good work!!!!,5
08/06/2021 22:43:33,Patrick Matthews,"First time having this problem: Google says they close at 6 on Fridays. I get there at 5:30 just to turn in a credit card application (no service needed), and the doors are already closed and locked. Maybe it's a new procedure, but I've been let in before with it being 10 minutes to closing with no problem. I was even told to ""turn it in in the morning"" through the locked door. I'll stick to the Ridgeway/Quince location for now on.",2
11/01/2021 15:52:52,Kayeshia Morris,"Went to deposit a money order Thursday  and Sharon decided to place a on hold it by saying it didn’t look right. Instead of giving me a direct answer, everyone gave me different answers. The so called manager Patricia told me “I should have deposited somewhere else to get the money.” The first lie was my account didn’t have any money and that was bs. The next lie was the money order from Walmart with the receipt didn’t look right which is a lie. Still waiting as of today and will never deposit money with them again. Never had an issue with the hickory hill location depositing a money order. They play with people time like it’s funny. Asked to speak to branch manager and was placed on hold for an extended amount of time.  Guarantee their money is their without any problems. I will be reporting this location to the BBB.",1
04/10/2020 15:30:08,Me Mom,"More then upset, during such tough time, an elderly lady was whooshed off as they didn't want to deal with her not tried to understand the needs! Yes, I have contacted the bank by phone, Robert, personnel, had taken my number and was clearly unhappy I wasn't willing to discuss with him but asked for a manager, simply hanged up (how about letting me know, that whom I asked for would give me a call back, or so to discuss?!",1
05/31/2022 15:39:26,Cicily Mathis,"1 of employment ( a Tall heavy set white man) gave an attitude and unprofessional communication with a deaf lady, so another Manger guy who was helpful with deaf lady. So I'm give this 1 star because 1. Lousy attitude,  2. Unprofessional communication with a deaf person.",1
02/11/2020 19:29:49,Justin & Christian Sports,Rude person answering the phone.  Put me on hold for 10 minutes.  I ended hanging up the phone.  I guess I have to drive to the branch to get my issue resolved.  Very far from convenience service for customers.,1
08/06/2020 19:03:39,Kameron Haywood,if I could give NO stars I would . the staff is very unprofessional and uneducated. the person answering the phone is very rude and doesn’t know how to do her job correctly . this bank needs to be reported !,1
