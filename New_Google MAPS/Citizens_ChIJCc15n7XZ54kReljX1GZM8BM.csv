What they have done to me is this.  When I make purchases, they deliberately do not take money out of my account until I have a very low balance, causing me to overdraft $35.00 each time.

A while ago, they did another backhanded method to me.  They always send emails when you overdraft and decline your card when you overdraft.  This time, they did not send an email and allowed me to overdraft on a declined card.  Having a burger and ribs with my brother on the 4th of July, didn't cost me $20 at a restaurant, it ended-up costing me almost $60 because of Citizens Banks' snaky methods.

I paid over $700 with these dishonest practices.  They won't tell you that their policy is to forgive one $35.00 overdraft charge a year, and they act snarky about this too.

This is a company that takes advantage of the working class, people with debts and people who live paycheck to paycheck. Watch your account daily and always keep $100.00 in your accounts that you do not plan to spend, to insure against overdrafting.",1

Their Loan Officer Michael Montelli is rude, dismissive and arrogant.  They hook you on a line of credit, then jerk you around until all you can think about is taking your business elsewhere.   Michael is particularly devious doing underhanded things without telling you, such as changing terms/conditions etc.",1
