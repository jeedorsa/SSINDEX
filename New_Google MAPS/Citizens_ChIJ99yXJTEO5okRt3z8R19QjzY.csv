The ATM's are constantly out of order, and the attachment to accept ""multiple"" cash bills has never once worked for me. I have on multiple occasions had to insert single 20's in one at a time for what felt like an eternity. Also, my debt card expires this month, and unlike every other bank in the world, they did not send me a replacement. When I called, they claimed they sent me a replacement, but I am very diligent about checking my mail and have been looking for my new card. It turns out they ""forgot"" to mail me a new card. In order to receive the card within 1-3 business days I would have to pay $12, for their mistake. Now in order to send me a new card, they will have to change my card number, leaving me unable to pay a single bill this month until I get that new card, I am beyond livid that I do not have access to MY OWN MONEY!!!!! Appalling. I will be closing all my accounts with this bank, after 5 years I have had more than enough.",1
