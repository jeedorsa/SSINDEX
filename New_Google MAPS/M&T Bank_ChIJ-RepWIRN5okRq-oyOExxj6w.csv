03/16/2024 13:34:00,James Matthew Neeland,"Whether at the local branch in Wethersfield or over the phone with their main customer service number, the experience has been consistently high-quality; friendly, professional staff and easily navigable automated prompts. The transition from People's United to M & T was handled with care & courtesy, seamless. I have read other reviews of M & T here, some of them actually deserving of their own critique by virtue of how easily the ""problem(s)"" could have resolved with more competence, and much less fumbling, on the part of the person writing the bad review(s). It's not that complex: You get back what you give. If you approach a situation from the outset with arrogance and little understanding of the mechanics of your issue (yet, of course, believing you know more about banking than the bankers), don't feign shock and surprise when your performance leaves them cold. They are customer service reps, not your own personal assistants. Find out about your problem first, then speak intelligently about it to them, with civility, rather than expect them to solve an issue you have made murky from the first . . . Thank you. (Had to get that out there.) We have had great service from (and great rates with) M & T. What else does a bank need to do?",5
11/28/2023 16:37:35,irving barnor,"I went to the bank to cash  $7000  check my wife wrote to me from a business account. After verifying my identity,  the Teller said he needed to to ask my wife a few questions. I called my wife and she answered the question(s) satisfactorily.  All of a sudden, a couple of workers started whispering in the Teller's ears. The Teller then said he had to call my wife. He attempted 3 times, my wife did not pick up. He the gave me the check and ID back saying he cannot proceed with the transaction.  I  called my wife only to find out they never called her. They pretended they were calling but never actually did.
There is one and only one reason they treated me that way: I am a black man trying to cash a $7000 check!",1

I spent  10 minutes pushing buttons before the card ejected. The drive-thru area is atrocious, I damaged my car trying to leave due to all the pillars and giant curbs.",1
12/01/2023 07:09:10,Ronald DeRobertis,"Apparently M + T Bank is paying for the consolidation of People's United with all types of Bank Fees added
Why should long time customers have to pay for their Corporate Greed and Heaven Help.You If You Suddenly Need To Use A Restroom.  They Don't Have One
I am a older man and they just don't care for your needs.  Bank somewhere else",1

10/18/2021 23:49:40,Cheryl Miller,"Sold home in 5/2020 and moved out of state. Called at least 10 times over a month period to get tax forms for income tax filing, told sorry need to complete change of address form, did it, waited 10 days and again same response need to change address on banks form! Did this several times always saying they did not receive it and I even took copies of form and where i mailed and faxed it too! Never received a thing, BUT I did received new checks from the home equity account (for a house I no longer owned) with our new address on them! Two months later I get a bill for the home Equity letter saying a lien is on the house I no longer own because we didn't pay the home equity loans yearly renewal fee! Really PEOPLE! Again spoke to multiple people including the lawyer who closed the house for us and showed us were they had paid the loans off! Poor customer service all around!",1
08/16/2022 17:34:13,sss ggg,"This is worst bank. They claim to provide notary service to their customers. I needed few documents notarized. They refused to do it even though me being their customer for more than 24 years. I went to local ups store, paid $5 per seal and got the documents notarized.",1
12/28/2020 19:00:01,Sheri,"As we know COVID has changed many things for everyone. However, went through the drivethru today and it took me 40 minutes to get to the window because the person in front of me had several transactions and was unprepared for each transaction.  One would think she should have been told to go inside for all of these transactions but I found out the lobby was closed due to too many people being out sick.  They should have limited her to one or two transactions not 30 minutes worth.  The reason Iâ€™m upset about this is because I withdrew 3k not that long ago through the drivethru and was told to go inside the next time due to the larger sum of money. Seriously???!!!!  Iâ€™m contemplating moving my funds to another bank.",1
03/22/2022 20:16:58,Paul Gilbert,Went to the Wethersfield branch today with a client and they would not let her deposit insurance checks to pay her contractors because they said it was a two party check. Lousy customer service and no concern for their or my client. ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž,1
