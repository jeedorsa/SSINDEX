02/07/2024 22:27:41,Anna Palmer,I spoke with a man on the phone 02/07/2024  to try and stop a payment when I knew who it was coming from and how much and he said he couldn’t do it and I had to come in and it would be 30 minutes before anyone could see me . He didn’t even ask for my name or look up my account to even try and help .I get y’all are almost closing however don’t have this job if you aren’t going to help. However the Nolensville first horizon was AMAZING and was great and helped me OVER THE PHONE!,1
09/22/2023 14:44:35,Talk Truth,"There is a lady at Thompson Lane known as Haley who is very unprofessional. She seems annoyed when talking over the phone. I am not a fan of calling this bank. The branch directs calls to customer service, and customer service directs you to the branch. The bank app is always giving trouble and they always having technical difficulties with their debit card. Just know it's best to buy a calculator and a note pad when you join this bank. Use that calculator and the notepad to track your own spending or transactions because balances take forever to update.",1
01/11/2024 16:07:23,Michael Rakes,Always friendly service. FTB / FHB has been my bank for over 40 years both personal and business.,4
05/04/2023 19:17:29,Julia Sutherland,"Everyone at this branch is so helpful. We have opened multiple accounts with our residents, who are all ages and from diverse background, and they are so patient and kind. Great customer service!",5
03/05/2023 12:51:08,Angie,"Been banking here for years and service has always been outstanding. Yesterday, they helped my daughter set up her own bank account. Thank you!",5

Color based discrimination

Discriminated me on the basis of color
Bank associates asked me if I really have an account inspite of me providing an ID and ac number . I took out my debit card to shut their mouth. They simply said systems are down while serving other customers through drive-through window",1
11/24/2021 15:21:03,Angel Coleman,"They have been taking my money due to machine technicalities.I’ve been having issues with this bank.Today is the second time,I have deposited well over 1k and I count it t several times and put in a deposit slip with it.I’m told I’m several hundred short.I’d understand if I was a couple dollars short,but several hundreds????
First time this happened,I was told,thier machines never lie.I said maybe it was the in between process,from the drive through to the machine.
Second time was today,and it was several hundreds off.I asked for my cash back and went in  .It was the amount I had put in there.
The lady apologized perfusely and said our machines have been off lately with the numbers but you should try our ATMs.
First of all How may hundreds of dollars has this branch taken from me.
I don’t feel comfortable banking here.
Please be aware of what’s going on.Think twice before banking here.It might not be the bank for you.",1
10/09/2017 13:55:06,Marco Juarez,Have been with them for about a year. I have no complaints about them usually when the tellers are busy the bankers help out make deposits to get everyone on their way.  Thats something I dont see at other banks which is something they need to do. I previously banked with Bank of America that is next door to them but waiting in line for more than 30 minutes for a deposit was ridiculous also charging me fees left and right.,5
09/26/2020 07:18:28,Andrew Goodwyn,"The app isn't very good, but I hear they recently hired the guy from USAA and  they have the best mobile app ever for a bank. Hopefully they will step up their mobile app game since it's 2020.

The staff is super friendly and always so helpful. Really my only gripe is the mobile app, but I use First Horizon for business, so I almost never look at my bank on the app, pretty much always on my computer.",4
07/05/2021 20:49:26,paul dodds,"Worst bank ive ever had the displeasure of having to do business with.  Hours are a joke, hardly any ATM service, the ATM at this location almost ALWAYS broken. We'd be better off trading with frogskins!!",1
10/01/2019 14:21:09,Melissa Lynn Bryan,First Tennessee staff are always friendly and helpful. They are very understanding and they listen to you when you tell them your issues with your financial issues. I recommend FIRST Tennessee Bank to anyone that is looking a Bank to do financial business with,5
02/25/2022 17:57:45,Caden Lackey,This place absolutely doesn’t even deserve a one star customer service is 0/10 I think some kids coordinate that place better just left there they only have line open not to mention there’s three cars in line and on top of that the atm is not even working sat there for 30 mins before next car moved up employees always rude communication skills just as bad place might as well just be ran out of business very very poorly owned and operated,1
09/03/2021 19:25:48,Austin King,Worst First horizon branch. I had a dispute on why I couldn't  cash check. They kept telling me different  rules on why I couldn't cash check. I took it to another branch and check was cashed without problems. Do not go to thompson lane branch.,1
05/13/2021 13:17:54,James Ho,The employees at the bank have right open the cusomers file without any reason? The employee Grimes Baird at Thompson LN did. He told me he looked at my accounts twice this week. I asked him why  but he refused to answer. Rediculous!,1
05/15/2021 16:26:46,John Wang,The bank is good but some employees at Thompson LN Branch are not good. They don't care the business as well they don't care of their company.,1
10/24/2017 17:24:59,Calvin Fields,"Nice people.  So, so, very slow.  Can take 30 min for simple transaction.  Probably the slowest branch, and bank I've ever used.",1
12/03/2017 21:33:43,Clayton Clark,"Very mediocre bank. Features are years behind other banks like Wells Fargo. Convenient bank if you live in Nashville, though.",3
03/12/2019 17:11:21,Nathan c,"I would be ashamed to call this my bank, if you don't have an account and bring them their own check they charge  $20 to cash it. Shame on you",1
