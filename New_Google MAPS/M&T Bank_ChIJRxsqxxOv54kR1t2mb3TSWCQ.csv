I came in because I was confused on how my 3 accounts were working but he helped me troubleshoot and quickly solve the problem.

He was very knowledgeable about all the M&T products and was very patient in assisting me.

Thanks for the help Mike!",5

If you had an FSB account you now have a People's account, and you may run into issues cashing checks and making routine transactions. This has become a major inconvenience for most current and prior account holders.  My suggestion is to try one of the 6 other banks cluttered within walking distance, including BofA, Webster or the Berkshire Bank on Rt. 4.",2
