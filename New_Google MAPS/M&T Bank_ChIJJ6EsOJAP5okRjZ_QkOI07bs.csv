M&T Bank carelessly withdrew $1,000 from my checking account. To compound matters, the name on the check did not match mine, and the individual's information was from New York, whereas I reside in Connecticut. This incident highlights the importance of diligently monitoring your transaction history. Needless to say, I'm rather displeased with the situation.",1
