Definitely better service than BOA or Charter both of which I refuse to ever deal with again.  The only thing would ask is for a better location for the Mystic branch because downtown is not very convenient due to the traffic and drawbridge etc.  Maybe something in Old Mystic?  Its comforting to know they have branches all over New England, especially when traveling.  Overall I would recommend Citizens!",5

03/22/2018 11:54:53,brittany Higgins,I was very impressed with their service. I went to this branch a couple months ago and a manage came out to help me with the ATM in the freezing cold. I was very grateful!,5
