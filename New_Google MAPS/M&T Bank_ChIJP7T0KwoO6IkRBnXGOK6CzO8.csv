09/15/2022 18:45:04,Atiya Sample,"On September 7, 2022 I visited the branch inside of the stop and shop located  in Fairfield , Connecticut. Devin, a teller, Had difficulty identifying my account. He proceeded to tell me that I was a beneficiary on a few accounts. He should NOT divulge this type of information. I explain to him what a beneficiary was and despite his claim that he knew , I didn‚Äôt believe him. If I am a beneficiary on an account I can‚Äôt possibly be the account owner , and therefore it is not my account. üôÉ Upon writing my account number on my withdrawal slip I indicated to him that he used the correct number he replied with a sigh ‚Äú that‚Äôs all you had to say.‚Äùü§î All I had To do was provide my identification as I did. It‚Äôs not my responsibility to help Devin do his job. I made a complaint with Beverly,  a manager. Beverly indicated that she would be off the next day and she will follow up with me - I have yet to receive a return phone call. I will withdraw all of my money and close the account in the very near future.

I refuse to bank with a bank that employs a rude teller that requires my assistance in identifying my account.

If you are aware that you are a beneficiary on someone‚Äôs account- DO NOT bank here!",2
06/09/2023 22:49:00,Sharaya Smith,"I had to go to the new M&T main branch, downtown Bpt after receiving poor service from calling the general customer service line. The agent over the phone seemed to be knowledgeable about the options available to me for my situation and she made me believe that a new card was on it's way to me. Lo and behold, I never received it. In addition, I later found out that there was no record of any new cards for me for this year even though there should have been 2. I got called up to Liljana's window, immediately when I got in line and she took care of everything, and unlike when I waited over a week previously,  she got my card delivered to me in one day! She also let me customize the card and she provided kind customer service as she has done in the past. A huge weight has been lifted off of my shoulders.",5

03/11/2024 17:13:22,Ashley foster,Very rude and unprofessional staff. It takes two seconds to give someone customer service even if you are with someone.,1
10/30/2023 17:46:16,Ayana Atkinson,"really a terrible place to set up a joint account. Even if your name is on it, they will not allow you to view the balance of the account. Terrible service , terrible banking.",1
02/05/2022 22:51:24,JM Berkshire,"They have high fees (and they increased without warning) so I decided to move my business elsewhere. They were somewhat rude and extremely unhelpful when I tried to close my HSA account. Part way through the process they suddenly request a notarized signature even though that wasn't on the paperwork given to me.  So I opened a credit union account and asked the credit union for help. My credit union had trouble with the forms, wrong fax numbers on the forms, etc. My credit union rep told me she certainly understood why I was getting frustrated with People's. Eventually it got done, and  I was out of this nightmare of a bank. But it was probably three weeks. Help yourself out; avoid this bank if you don't like high fees and poor customer service. Oh and my employer used this bank too, but they got frustrated as well and changed banks. So it's not just peons that get treated poorly here. And they'll charge you an high fee to boot.",1
09/15/2021 19:53:09,Sam Kretzmer,"Everyone who works at this branch of People's Bank are truly amazing.  Every time I go to the bank, they are always so happy to see me and they ask me how I am and they ask how members of my family are doing.  They truly care about me.  They always go out of their way to help me.  They were even there for me during the pandemic.  I am honored to have met all of them.  They are like family to me.  They are always very helpful to my clients and they always go out of their way to help us.  I highly recommend going to this bank.  You will be treated like royalty.",5
06/08/2022 15:45:16,Ian Olow,"Found out this morning after trying to pay a doctors bill that Peoples had stopped offering HSA's and that my HSA account was being handled by an entirely different company. I opened my Peoples App and the account was just gone. I called Peoples and they gave me the phone number for the new company that now owned my account.
My Grandmother was with Peoples before it was Peoples. She helped me open my first account with them in the 1990's. Once married, my wife and I had 5 accounts at Peoples. I am shopping around for a bank that can better serve my needs as this situation just solidifies my worries about the M&T merge.
With the amount of junk mail that I receive from Peoples, I have no doubt that I likely threw out any info about their handling of my HSA if it came by snail mail, but I revolve my finaces around their mobile app and still had NO CLUE they were doing this. Some kind of message or alert in the app would have been great, aside from going to pay a bill and being declined and then signing in to see that my account was just gone.",1
06/23/2021 23:30:32,Mike D,"After a complaint which I submitted to a state/fed agency, PUB stepped up and helped.  TY.  Can't say that my attorney was great or even good.

Less than a 1 rating.  This ""bank"" has dragged its feet for months on the simple closing of an account to settle an estate.  Our attorney has stated that they are a nightmare.",4
03/23/2021 20:40:42,Ed Berndt,"I've been a customer since the early 90's....had my paycheck deposited regularly.  Later, I had all of my travel expenses direct deposited. With covid crisis, no more travel - no more expense deposits.  They started charging $25 A MONTH to keep the account.   On line - I asked what was going on - they said I didn't keep enough in the account.  Went to a branch and said I'd like to close it due to the high maintenance fees (silly me- I thought they would care).  Nothing.  I closed the account along with my overdraft loan account.   Pretty disappointing end to a 30 year banking relationship.",1
03/20/2020 05:59:47,Patricia Kearns,"I sent court papers, death certificate(twice) to People's to close a small, joint checking account of my deceased husband and me and to transfer that money into his Estate account set up by the Probate court in the state where we  both lived and I continue to live. People's has never complied or sent me any communication regarding this matter.  Now I must take further legal action through my attorney, costing me more money. So tell me about their great customer service.",1
07/21/2022 18:25:15,R. Alecia,Worst. Bank. Everrrrrr. They hit you with extremely high fees and the staff is beyond rude. I was hung up on by a back office supervisor when trying to settle something that happened to my account and this lady hung up on me because she couldn‚Äôt deal with the conversation‚Ä¶ I have never dealt with a more unprofessional group of employees than the back office department of this company. No wonder they were bought out by another bank‚Ä¶,1
09/26/2016 16:13:48,Eric LaCore,"The customer service keeps getting worse and worse.
Not to mention the quality of their products.
In my case my account which I opened with ""lifetime"" no ATM fee's was changed. Its possible I was notified by mail (along with all the other junk mail received).
I asked to have the fee's waived (only the past 2 months with which I've become aware of the ATM/Maint fee's) and the agent refused. I asked to speak with a supervisor (who was snappy and rude) who only agreed to a partial refund of one of the incidents.
Seems like this bank is more interested in making money on tiny fee's then keeping an otherwise satisfied customer of 10 years.",1
05/29/2020 20:23:47,"BirdCam Greater Toronto, Canada","My son received a gift card (Master card ‚Äúperfect gift‚Äù) for his birthday. As the value on the card was unfortunately not used up within one year, we unknowingly incurred ‚Äúmaintenance fees‚Äù that completely wiped out the value of his gift card. This bank stole the money from my son‚Äôs gift card under the pretext of $3/month ‚Äúmaintenance fees‚Äù. You‚Äôre doing anything to maintain these cards. I am utterly shocked and disgusted by your actions! Never in my life have a received a gift card from a company that acts this way. You should be ashamed of becoming rich this way, by stealing from kids‚Äô gift cards!!!",1
05/27/2020 15:22:38,Matt Listro,Since the merger I have only been able to access the online account portal once.  Customer service is either closed or a 40 minute wait time.  I just called to close the account and they won't even do that for me - they require a notarized written statement to close the account. OMG - stay away from them - very disorganized and not customer friendly!,1
05/11/2017 14:17:24,Sal,"Love it!!! Everyone is so friendly, and really treats me like a king!!! Best Custumer service. Can call on the phone and they recognize my voice, and they will do as much for me as they possibly can.  Wouldn't change it for the world!!!",5
