They have just finished an electronics  ""upgrade"" and your interest will not be printed correctly in it. I tried to bring it to their attention and was basically blown off. The Newtown branch totally treated this as a non issue. Their customer service dept. referred me back to the local branch, said they'd call me back twice, never did. Their treatment of me as a customer leaves much, much to be desired.
