Her friends encouraged her to use Torrington Savings Bank (TSB) instead. While I wasn't happy with the decision at the time, I am thrilled now. The service is unparalleled. I wish they were a national/global brand so I could use them. Every interaction feels so personal. Staff are committed to helping and know how to do what you need in a single call.

If there were more stars I'd be giving them more stars.

https://www.yelp.com/biz/torrington-savings-bank-torrington?osq=Torrington Savings Bank,Torrington Savings Bank,2,"Other lenders tend to recommend TSB if you have any kind if minor credit issues and you need a loan, they say because a local bank usually has more leverage.  I get it is not TSB's fault that other lenders say this but TSB dose claim to have excellent customer service , excessive knowledge of loans,  and can offer real hometown banking.  This may be true if you earn 50-100 thousand dollars are year and bank with them, or you have stellar credit.  If you do not fall into any of these categories forget it , not only will you be denied without any opportunity to speak with someone ( if you apply online ) , you also will not hear ANYTHING from anyone in regards to your loan status. You can call , email and you will just get the run around, and in the end just get a letter in the mail saying your denied.  The letter they sent me said my credit was just barley 500, but I have reports directly from all 3 credit bureau's and they all matched at 660.  I tried to get a opportunity to show them this and question why they where 160 points less but was never given the opportunity , they just didn't want to hear it.    I went with another local lender and was very pleased with there professionalism , courtesy and communication even though they could not help me now, they are helping me get where I need to be so they can offer me a excellent loan and rate in another 6 months.

I have done business with them for years.  They have been around for like 100 years and will be around for a lot longer.  A true hometown bank.  They're from the area and they understand it.  They hold onto all of the mortgages they write, and I'll bet they have written very, very few bad loans over the years.  Makes me feel even more angry about taxpayer bailouts of so many other greedy know-nothing banks who were out to give no income verification loans to any idiot they could sell one to, because the banks never intended to hold onto the loans in the first place, but rather sell them to be camouflaged into derivatives to be sold to other, unsuspecting fools.  Well, off my soapbox.  I don't expect TSB to ever be swallowed up by a megabank, and as long as they remain the same hometown bank, they've got my business.",[],"{'helpful': 0, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 0, 'oh_no': 0}",01/09/2010 03:11:32,1263006692,0EKeKcUfUPmPFArh9y4RUQ,Jim H.,2,0,31,"Torrington, CT",,oMqZps1x86XPJNxUyy2G8Q,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=oMqZps1x86XPJNxUyy2G8Q,,,,,
