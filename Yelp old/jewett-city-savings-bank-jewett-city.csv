I made an online credit card payment to my cardholder which was a bit more than the amount in my checking account because I didn't account for my insurance payment being deducted at the same time. My savings account had a more than adequate amount to cover the difference, however, the two were not linked. Ultimately, this led to three separate $27 fees. I don't have extra to spend on their ridiculous fees. Not only have I been a customer for years, I've had direct deposit for all of those years.

I keep a low amount in my checking just for the purpose of paying bills. I keep a small amount in my savings which is linked to my checking in case there is an overdraft. I receive an amount every two weeks in order to pay some local bills, credit cards, etc. Sometimes the amount of the check is higher than the amount in the checking and savings put together. Not by much. Each time the teller has to go through the drill of telling me that she/he has to place a hold on the money in my checking until the incoming check clears. Then they go and print something that they read to me, make me sign, and then send me on my way. The last time, a new teller had to check with a senior teller who scrutinized the check and loudly announced ""What is this? Alimony?"" Very loudly. I hate to tell the rude people at this bank - when I look at my accounts online, the hold happens automatically. Electronically. The warning is above the checking account online. And it comes off after the two day hold is up. The incoming check has never bounced. So what is the point of embarrassing me as a customer, making me wait until they print something (which I immediately shred), and then read it aloud to me as if I were mentally challenged.",[],"{'helpful': 0, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 0, 'oh_no': 0}",03/12/2017 22:00:00,1489356000,q-oOVhT-863JHv2iJ-lqdQ,Karen C.,0,0,5,"Griswold, CT",,uBzMPAmYT631TDVJLGiXrg,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=uBzMPAmYT631TDVJLGiXrg,,,,,
