https://www.yelp.com/biz/dime-bank-taftville?osq=Dime Bank,Dime Bank,1,"Never apply for a mortgage with Dime Bank (CT), EVER! 

Not only does Dime Bank have several non reimbursable fees that many other lenders don't have (such as Application Fees and Rate Lock fees), and less competitive interest rates than most of their competitors, but their entire lending department have zero sense of urgency and some of poorest communication/customer expectation management practices I've experienced to date in any industry. 

After wasting nearly $1000 in ""nonrefundable"" fees and four weeks trying to get Clear to Close/Mortgage Commitment with Dime Bank with little to no clarity or sense of progress, we had no choice but to switch lenders in order to meet the sales contract deadlines (which had already been amended and pushed back once) in our purchase and sale agreement. What Dime Bank couldn't accomplish in 4 weeks, a Mortgage Commitment Letter, FMC was able to accomplish in less than 1 week! 

But wait, it gets worse! After switching to Fairway Mortgage Company to get the loan processed, and withdrawing my application in writing from Dime Bank, their inept staff continued to negatively affect my loan being processed by the new Lender. How so? First, they failed to correctly transfer the Appraisal Report, originally booked through them, to the new lender despite this being standard practice and being provided with explicit instructions on how to do so. Next, they refused to provide a copy of the paid appraisal report invoice to my new lender which is required to have for Closing. Both of these failures caused delays and eventual postponements to our closing. 

And now the grand finale! So AFTER all this stress, frustration, poor communication and wasted time and money, I get a call from Johnna Taylor and Brian McNamarra. Two Senior VPs in the lending department. The purpose of their call? Is it to apologize for the frustrating experience? Is it to offer a full or partial rebate of fees I incurred? Nope! They called to speak to me for three reasons; 1. To attempt to justify their organizational ineptitude and deflect any responsibility.  2. To notify me that they will provide NO further assistance to me or my new lender as it pertains to documentation the new lender requires that they have. And 3. To attempt to persuade my wife and I to remove the negative reviews we left online. Pathetic! 

And just to put this to rest because I'm sure some of you reading this will question whether or not this was simply on me not being a good candidate for a loan: my credit score is ~745 depending on the reporting bureau, the only debt I have is an auto loan for ~$450/mo and I have well over six figures in the bank! 

In summary, I would never recommend using Dime Bank for a home loan unless you enjoy a painstakingly slow, nontransparent communication and immensely frustrating lending experience. In hindsight, had I gone with FMC from the get-go we probably would've closed within 3-4 weeks of putting the house under agreement! I'm sure Dime Bank successfully lends to people all the time. But from my experience, and what've I've found since diving deeper into them, they have an increasingly negative reputation when it comes to home mortgages! Save yourself from the stress and frustration, look elsewhere for a home mortgage lender!",[],"{'helpful': 1, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 0, 'oh_no': 0}",10/22/2020 17:32:31,1603387951,q2oUJ90j9fY6qF47wF7Jow,Michael S.,0,0,1,"San Francisco, CA",,QsxPdQxOsLcjSgOOpsywfA,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=QsxPdQxOsLcjSgOOpsywfA,,,,,

The ""blonde"" lady when I asked what I need to open the account, she just gave me some information and never even ask me if I want to open the account in that moment, I felt like I was bothering her with my questions.  Maybe the facts that I am an hispanic person was the reason why she didn't want to help me.
