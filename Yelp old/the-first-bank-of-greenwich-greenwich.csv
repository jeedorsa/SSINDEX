The personal attention, kindness and courtesy extended by all of the staff at this bank is truly above and beyond.
After several decades of business banking - and at several banks - the First Bank of Greenwich has, again and again, gone out of their way to help in all ways big and small, that I've not seen elsewhere.
In an era where decent customer service is constantly diminishing, this bank brings a refreshing and helpful level of focus and attention that's unfortunately hard to find elsewhere. And as a small business, with little to offer in terms of fat bank accounts, I still seem to get attention and service at the 10/10 level.",[],"{'helpful': 0, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 0, 'oh_no': 0}",11/10/2023 15:13:17,1699629197,t7eGzziwcs0NHDXCjsH58Q,Vincent C.,0,36,1,"Port Chester, NY",,6dBvLWmdP4rHYwe-47LNtw,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=6dBvLWmdP4rHYwe-47LNtw,,,,,
