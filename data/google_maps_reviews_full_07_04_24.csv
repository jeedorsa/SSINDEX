07/10/2021 16:09:31,Payam Moein,the agent I was assigned to for my mortgage was the most unprofessional and disrespectful bank agents I have ever seen. the first few encounters he seemed friendly. but he became very rude on the phone when I called him regarding a house we wanted to purchase on a holiday. this was part of his job to respond to clients on that holiday but he acted as if I was abusing him. in the last call that day he literally started yelling like a maniac and said I was using him and that I was wasting his time. in the end he said he would send me the letter but he didn't want to hear from me again and hung up. I was in shock how a bank agent treats customers like that. later I heard he is well known to be cranky but that definitely does not make the bank look good. I switched to a different bank the same day and found a very professional agent who helped me and we actually got a mortgage with a lower interest rate. make sure you shop around and think twice before choosing this bank for mortgage.,1,Newtown Savings Bank - Newtown Office_ChIJeS-BfEL754kRp47FkrXFUa0.csv,Citizens Bank

It's wonderful knowing the staff at the bank knows your name it makes you feel welcomed, invited and cared for.

Veronica was an absolute joy to work with. She not only helped me open a money market account but also a checking account. She is always smiling and happy, I love that about her.
I appreciate all her efforts.

Showing me the ins and outs of how it all works.
I definitely recommend banking here.

Looking forward to speaking with Walter Romero who does their investments here at this branch.

I had opened an account with Webster Bank, they required a thousand dollar monthly balance in my checking account. So I decided to see what my jobs bank offers which is Fairfield County Bank, they only require a hundred dollars. So it's pretty self explanatory why I closed my Webster account and brought my money here to Fairfield County Bank.

I just want to say.. such a great experience over all.

09/25/2018 17:28:08,BUBSR Mort,"I never complain online but felt it only necessary to do this today.Please keep in mind that I have been with FFD County Bank since the late 90’s and have my paycheck directly deposited to a account with them. I went  to the Bridgeport branch to get some temporary  checks made. I’m out of checks. I only write approximately 20 some odd checks a year from this account and really don’t want to order 100 or so checks.I asked them to print me some checks while parked at the drive up window. I was asked to please come inside. This I did. First County bank will do this whenever I need it at the window, never a problem and totally uneventful at any branch. Not with the Bridgeport Ffc bank. Their business came to a complete stop with my asking for some checks.
There were no customers whatsoever in the bank other than myself.The tone set here was like dealing with a bureaucracy who only wants to tell you NO simply because they can say NO. Not unlike a DMV joke. After three tellers and or managers or whatever they were teaming up against me behind their bulletproof window to equally support their position of telling me NO and that I have to order checks In order to get this otherwise act of goodwill. After my complaing and rejecting their request, they finally gave in and printed up THREE  free checks.This took all of 20 seconds to print the checks. It SEEMED to be a very very difficult task for them. I would suggest they charge me per check, that would be fair. Not here, it became an act of Congress and a very unpleasant experience for something so simple. It’s was very petty and wrong.
Customer service should be happy and nice and accommodating. Please print the checks with the suggestion of ordering more checks. It only took 20 seconds to print the checks, I can’t stress that enough, twenty seconds. And this was only  once someone decided to stop resisting taking care of a customer. It did take them three people to tell me no and fill out the free check ledger that I had to sign.
I am in customer service and have learned that telling my customers no or trying to teach them a lesson simply does not work, it does not get me more customers. It is a must that I go out of my way to accommodate my client in order to keep their business.
I will say that in the past whenever working with the  Norwalk office on new Canaan Avenue, they have always been great and very accommodating and appreciative of my business. Or so it seems to me. Gail Who is in Norwalk is always very understanding and has gone the extra steps several times in the recent past for me when in fact she did not have to.I did not have to beg her or persuade her she simply took care of me. I appreciate her very much and don’t know why the Bridgeport branch would be run any differently.",1,Fairfield County Bank_ChIJN71NwvQO6IkRPGdXa3ogiQo.csv,Ion Bank

Further, though payments were being made, they still demanded the loan due while our business was fully impacted from Covid. They also sent miscalculated payments (clearly in their favor), and when it came to SBA assistance programs, we had to follow up with them to share the latest.

Having worked with the public for many years myself, I would like to suggest something to those who are not satisfied.  When you approach someone, do so with a smile on your face.  Say ""hello, how are you today?"" before you tell them what you need them to do for you.  They are there to help you.  Just try it and see what happens.  No one wants to be greeted  with a demanding approach.  Do you?  Take this suggestion in the manner it is intended. This is also a good thing to do when calling on the phone.  I find that many times it is a
surprised reaction when I greet them in this way before I explain what I need from them.  I am not  downing  anyone. We all have bad days and personal struggles.  So does the staff.  If you have a problem, remember that they did not create it but will help you solve it or suggest what can be done.  In these hard times it is especially important that we remember that we are all in this together.

I moved 6 and a half years ago to another state but kept the account open and active for loyalty reasons. However I came to find out that they changed their policy and was charging me fees for months without knowing. When I called to try to get the fee's back they refused and said they would refund me 34 dollars. It was over 300 dollars of fees they charged me. They then never sent me the check and I followed up multiple times with no answer. I then closed the bank account. They then continue to charge me overdraft fees for an account I closed! I called and now they will only refund me 24 dollars and are officially closing my account.

If you use the debit card then that counts towards your daily usage so you can no longer withdraw funds from the ATM after you use a purchase in a store unacceptable for a business as far as I'm concerned. Can't use the debit card at the gas pump because it flags it for some type of fraud protection it's really just an all-around bad experience we'll be changing back to Bank of America.,1,Essex Savings Bank - Madison Branch_ChIJuX1Q9U8p5okRQ9qhjdmrs1U.csv,Dime Bank

08/20/2021 14:31:47,Andre Stavis,Horrible experience as well I agree with the customer that spoke up about poor customer service. I contact my loan officer for a mortgage. He doesn’t answer the phone so then I text and email. I’ll ask a three to four part question because I’m a first time home buyer and have questions. He’ll respond exactly a week later with the shortest amount of words possible and misspell half his words which does t make any sense. Then he’ll respond to one out of my four questions. Which frustrates me. I also agree with the loss of paperwork. The paperwork I sent he claim to never received them. Till I contact the manager and she finds them in one minute. Now I’m advised to email both parties. But this happens more times than one or two and the manager is constantly making excuses for him! This will be the last time I deal with this bank and I will tell all my friends and family to stay away. In addition I email these two individuals about the conditions of my paperwork so I can make closing deadline and three emails in no response. I agree 100 and 10 percent with the review on poor customer service and when the bank responds how can they make this better…. Get new employees who care about there job. I’m sick and tired of corporate America protecting there own and making excuses anyone can clearly see these individuals don’t care. If I’m challenged on this I will post all my emails and responses and every potential customer will see. If I lose this deal due to the bank I’m going to seek funds of the money I invested.

03/09/2021 18:45:28,Jillian Musonda,"Update - Jul 2020: upon hearing of the displeasure with my service, the branch manager reached out to our family to personally apologize and connect with us. The issue was resolved quickly and is imagine this is the service everyone is familiar with in banking with this branch. If you’re local, don’t hesitate to check out this bank.

Very unhappy with the service from this branch. Our family is working with this branch to handle finances from our late Uncle. As if dealing with the grief from his passing wasn’t hard enough, we are having to go through extra work to get our inheritance from this bank.

It’s been very difficult to work with them from afar - My family being in Maryland and myself in California. Twice we’ve received bank checks without being signed, at which time we’ve had to send them back for re-issuing.

Would not recommend this bank unless you live local and can proofread every document you receive from them in person— to save yourself the time.

Update: I’ve moved this up to 3 stars as upon seeing this review, the bank quickly course corrected with a sincere apology!! That’s good cuestiones service. I wish the issue didn’t happen in the first place, but I appreciate the way they handled the situation once this was escalated.",4,Thomaston Savings Bank_ChIJtYZd1T6T54kR9suhYq3zMc0.csv,Jewett City Savings Bank

The absolute worst bank to use if you own a small business by far.  All they do is look for any way possible to charge you their ridiculous fees over and over. As a small business, just me, it takes time to get invoices submitted to customers as I’m out working every day than need to do the billing myself.  The amount of fees I’ve paid in the three years is insane not to mention they love those $10 daily negative balance charges while checks are processing for payment.  They don’t even have the curtesy to answer emails.  I sent a email to the manager of New Canaan Ave branch, Isaac Walcott, to never hear back plus a follow up asking about it to no response.

Website is awesome, all features BOA have and more.  You can see your credit score! They have a thing called Money Manager 360 where you can link all your accounts (credit card, mortgage, investment accounts ect) so you can see your bottom line (net worth) in one place.

And get this, the women who opened my account, Yamina Berrabeth-Mayen gave me her card.  I've called twice since opening the account, both times she picked up after a few rings.  Imagine that, talking to a live person at your local branch!

01/15/2019 17:08:15,Those Guys,"After attempting to use the ATM and suffering through the $3 service charge, the ATM here has a locking mechanism that does not allow you to immediately take back your card; an increasingly common and inconvenient aspect in bank ATMs nowadays. My displeasure of having to pay $3 to remove 20 from my own account with a local bank, I have course forgot my ATM card in the Locking device.

2 hours later Upon returning when I realized I was without my ATM card, I went into the bank to claim it providing photo ID, and was probably told that for my own security my card was destroyed because a kind citizen had done the right thing and returned it. So, the policy of this bank is when somebody does the right thing, and then someone comes to claim their property with the proper ID within an extraordinarily reasonable amount of time, we're going to overly complicate your day by destroying the thing you rely upon for your business.

Thanks for making what would have been a simple problem substantially more difficult, and more time consuming.

I neglected to patronize your bank in the past for several reasons. I will add this one to the list as to why, despite being surrounded by this institution, I refuse to keep my money with them.

The branch has no lobby ATM, so if the drive-through one is out of service (as it sometimes is) you either have to go inside and fill out a slip to make a checking account withdrawal or, if it's after hours, find yourself out of luck.

When I set up a business account here, the manager misspelled the name of my company and didn't enroll me in e-statements, prompting a 20-minute call to customer service to reverse the paper statement charges.

This branch doesn't have a change machine. Bank staff will instead request that you roll all your change for processing -- something I haven't done since the turn of the millennium.

05/07/2013 16:23:07,Alex Geden,"I am incredibly disappointed with Newtown Savings Bank. I started a refinance in February 2013, and it has been nothing but frustrations since.

Here are some of the issues I have with Newtown bank:

- Sent me multiple GFEs & Truth in Lending Docs with the wrong terms (I asked for a 20yr loan, and kept getting a 30yr)
- Not accepting anything but a voided check in order to do direct deposit. I even got a letter head from my previous bank stating my routing / account number but wasn't informed that was not good enough till a day before my closing.
- Doubling a coupon book fee. Because of their ""new"" system I was charged twice for a coupon book fee. They didn't tell me though,  I had to ask why my charge was suddenly higher to get it removed.
- Having two different monthly payments displayed between my commitment letter and truth in lending document. Why would they send me information that displayed two different estimates? Clearly no one read the documents before sending them out.
- Mysterious additional charges onto my origination fees. Thought origination fees are not suppose to change? Well not at Newtown Bank if you don't read correctly you may be paying extra for nothing.
- Requiring me to change my deductible on my homeowners insurance to $1000, literally 4 hours before my closing. It's one thing to tell me that your bank has a maximum deductible requirement. It's a completely different issue to inform your customer of that piece of information hours before closing, putting them into a position which is difficult to change without paying hundreds of dollars extra per year.

Bottom line: I won't bank with Newtown ever again on any services they offer and it's not that just I won't recommend that people do business will Newtown, I will go out of my way to inform everyone of my bad banking experience and implore them not to do business with Newtown. (I already convince one person looking to refinance, so your loss Newtown.)",2,Newtown Savings Bank - Monroe: Clock Tower Square_ChIJgaGEO6_i54kRn4W94_f2cCM.csv,First Bank of Greenwich

I've worked at the same place, a local company, for a few years and was always able to cash my payroll checks on the spot. The other day, the polite banker told me they had changed their policy and couldn't cash the check; the money wouldn't be available for a day or two. I Explained how I'd had no problems doing this here, with the same check, for years. I asked to speak to her manager. She went over to the manager and came back without the manager, saying ""she said no."" I asked again, ""Can I speak to her?"" This time, the manager begrudgingly came over, graciously mblessing me with 2 minutes of her time. She was clearly burdened, did not express an ounce of understanding to my very reasonable points, and just kept saying ""it'll be available in 2 days.""

03/23/2019 18:19:46,Amy Pagnozzi,"While the staff is friendly and able, the consumer services are strictly one star in terms of modern banking. Limited hours (not a single late night -- closes at 4 pm on the dot), no useful web presence (or phone access -- both buggy), NO WAY TO MAKE A DEPOSIT APART FROM A VISIT (remote deposits are only for commercial customers). This might not matter so much if Whalley Avenue address wasn't their ONLY location. Worse, any deposit larger than $500 triggers a 7 day hold before your check clears, regardless of whether the check is personal, a bank check or a money order.  Moreover, despite supposedly being a member of the Allpoint network, you cannot deposit a check via Allpoint and there are no plans to incorporate this ability as Allpoint rolls it out.  Last time I stopped in, I asked for labels or mailing envelopes so I could at least use snail mail but they didn't have any, nor do they have a link to download a label template so you can print them out yourself. The $500 seven day hold was a shocker for me, given I purposely deposited a TD Bank check so it would clear quickly. (This unusually low limit is something that should be clearly disclosed before you trouble to open an account). Had I mailed a 'naked' check, I'd have assumed it had been lost. Also -- the website and telephone banking system are pretty buggy, even just to check your balance.
But above and beyond all this, the biggest negative is the limits on electronic withdrawals, given the limited business hours. $350! And if you've gotten twenty or forty bucks cash back at the supermarket the same day, they deduct it from your limit. All banks have limits but few are this low in 2019 and I don't know of any that refuse to raise the limit by account holder request. So as hard as it is to get money into your account, it's even harder to get it out.  (there's no phone app and no plans to create one). You can't even transfer money from your checking account to a Walmart money card -- I asked.
Because the employees are so nice, I wish I could rate higher, but two stars is generous, given the limited utility of consumer accounts. (Note that those employees have no discretion when it comes to waiving account limitations, however personable they are).
Start Bank might still be  a good choice for locals who are trying to establish a banking history if their only other likely checking account option is the (otherwise more useful) Walmart Money Card.
Really, though, a seven day hold on a $500 check -- especially a bank check -- is absurd, as is a supposedly old fashioned bank that doesn't have a mechanism to deposit checks via snail mail.",2,New Haven Bank_ChIJ_8gLmX3X54kR3ArU83Uep58.csv,First Bank of Greenwich

She said without an ID no account could be opened, then implied that most ""black people"" do not have ID's and asked to see mine, then made a copy of it as if to say she wanted to verify it was real, as its not bank policy to make copies of Id's, after seeing the id she claimed the account would be opened, then cited that she would not open an account , after avoiding my calls the next day.

As soon as I entered the bank , I felt an aura of racism and bigotry. I felt that I should have left as soon as entered the doors. If you are black and visit the bank be prepared to be treated in the fashion racist ran establishments such as these behave towards people of color. The experience was horrible , it's sad to think we live in a day and age that a bank manager would imply that because a person is black they do not have proper paperwork and an ID to open a bank account, but that's what happened to me.

There was a time in American history when it was illegal for black people to have bank accounts because of their skin color, the bank manager at ion bank made me realize that those days are still active at her branch.

Racism is most certainly real, the bank manager is well aware of what she did and what her intentions were , she assumed that because I am black that I had no id or paperwork and literally said this. If she did it to me, she's been doing it to other people, if she did it to you ? speak up about it. The only way we can stop racists is by reporting them and their actions,. Being pacifist is not the way to go.",1,Ion Bank_ChIJsSHUzMXA54kRAXk4ISqvrTM.csv,Liberty Bank
09/24/2018 20:42:00,Roots Wireless,I was surprised to meet the branch manager Mohammed walking into my store to introduce himself.  He was nearby meeting with another business customer and wanted to stop into local businesses to introduce himself.  I've never had my own bank who i have my account with come to visit me much less one I had nothing with.  I moved my personal account there and is in the works to move the business as well!!!!

When I walked into the branch I was surprised to see so many things being offered to customers (computer, coffee, lounge area)  The employees were very friendly too.  Looking forward to the relationship as I'm convinced to move my banking here with Mr. Hassan. (who is such a respectful young man).",5,Ion Bank_ChIJsSHUzMXA54kRAXk4ISqvrTM.csv,Liberty Bank
05/22/2018 20:16:37,Sara Gervais,"Worst bank I ever had to deal with in my whole life. I had so many problems with them I could write a storybook. I don’t want to have to say something like this but I definitely felt racially discriminated against by one person in particular she had glasses and dark hair. And it was how she treated me every single time she was there for example one time I came to the drive thru area and I was ready to do a transaction so I pressed the call button I saw her go to the window, look at me she gave me a dirty look then went off do something else... 15 minutes went by sitting there with my car running someone pulls up in their car and is helped in one minute and they leave ..(they looked nothing like me) I pressed the call button again and she rudely says “you’ll be helped in a minute” another 10 minutes went by and finally she helped me and had an attitude towards me like she was disgusted she had to help me. I waited there probably almost half an hour with my car running. Every time I went to the bank she had an attitude towards me and was nice to people who looked different than me. Another time she helped me there was a problem in my bank account and she felt the need to tell me how I should be handling my money and to “watch it” first of all it’s none of her business to be making any comments on my personal affairs and trying to tell me how I should be doing things. The biggest problem I had with her and the bank was when my name changed so I did all the paperwork and sent a request for a new card. I asked if they do temporary cards she said “no we don’t do that here” and she told me I would receive a card in one or two weeks ... long story short I waited 8 months for a card that I never got and I kept asking numerous times why it was taking so long and I was always told “must be lost in the mail it’s not our problem” or “just wait another week or two” ...I finally closed my account because I couldn’t deal with it anymore and I was so stressed out every time I had to go to the bank because I knew I would run into more problems. Don’t ever go to a bank like this so unprofessional.",1,Ion Bank_ChIJsSHUzMXA54kRAXk4ISqvrTM.csv,Liberty Bank

10/08/2023 03:56:05,Nicole O,"This bank is all around just awful as a business. Brick & mortar banks aren’t really necessary anymore and Liberty ESPECIALLY isn’t interested in keeping customers. I’ve been a customer for almost 20 years and I’ve reached the final straw and am in the process of closing all accounts with them. For almost everything you have to go to the physical location which is a nuisance. I had a fraudulent charge from a gym (after I canceled my membership they kept charging me). I called Liberty, explained my situation and that I had physical proof of the gym’s error. Liberty rep told me they wouldn’t even investigate. They immediately sided with the business. Since they’re business is making money off of their customer’s life’s earnings, they should have those customer’s backs when their earnings are taken fraudulently, but that’s not the case with Liberty. I HIGHLY recommend switching to Ally.

With just about every bill i have being on an automatic payment through my debit card # that would be a huge pita! Seriously? I bet a scammer can probably print a card out with my number on it and use it, but my bank can't? Wow. When I used the zelle service which they offer in their mobile app to transfer money it withdrew the money from my account twice and sent it to the recipient twice. Called the bank and they said there was nothing they could do I needed to call the recipient and have them send the money back to me. Wow again!

It also marked 30 years as a Fairfield County Bank, or Ridgefield Bank( as I fondly still refer to it as) customer.   I have always subscribed to the notion of supporting the local merchant, it is an opportunity to support your community as well as build important , lasting relationships that you can count on, and the latter rung true this year.  It goes without saying that 2020 was a tough year for all of us.  For those in business there were many ups and downs, but all along the way the Georgetown Branch management was there to help me stay afloat.

I came to this branch because I had a unique situation with my business & the PPP loan and I was seeking guidance, I was able to comfortably explain my situation to Ricky Arriaga over the phone, who then recommended that I get in touch with his manager, Anna Pace. After having a conference with Anna and Ricky, I felt confident that my issue would be taken care of. And I was not wrong, Anna and Ricky worked around the clock to make sure that I had the things I needed to resolve my situation in a timely manner. Mind you, I and my business were not even banking with First County at the time that I walked through their doors seeking help. Within the first five minutes of talking with Ricky and Anna, I wanted to move my business banking to their bank. My situation took less than a week to resolve, and I was not even a customer for the first couple of days, and that says a lot about their personal service and care for the people that walk into their branch. Fast forward to now, I am banking with them and constantly recommending my family and friends to go and open up an account at this branch. A personal touch, especially now a days seems like a lost touch, but this branch  has it and I can't say enough about it. Thank you so much Anna, Ricky, and Jason for your non stop help, and not resting until everything was done from all of us here at Mark S Gross CPA PC.",5,First County Bank_ChIJ3fwRc6qYwokRcZSgcgVonT4.csv,Chelsea Gronto Bank

11/23/2023 15:43:50,Joseph “Scott” Brusa,"Location and people in branch were fine. Bank itself has worst customer service and policies I've experienced in any bank large or small, in 35+ years of banking throughout the US (and that's saying something, there's a lot of terrible banks out there).  Pretty absurd, unreasonable and unapologetic.  Find another bank.

I'll give one example of the half dozen or so ridiculous experiences I've had in just a couple months as a customer (which they actually make fairly difficult to become - almost as if they're doing you some kind of favor).  Traveling for business earlier this week, tried to access the account and apparently entered the wrong password.  Get a message that the account is now locked.  Tried again, account is locked.  One wrong attempt - and I don't even think it was wrong.  So I try to reset password....which you can't do without entering your account number - which I don't write down and is on my desk at home.  EVERY other bank I've EVER dealt with will allow a password reset or account access either with basic info, or with other info (SSN, etc.) - and if not through the website/app, then at least through calling in.  Called them Monday.  Not this bank.  Get back from trip last night, go to the password reset page and enter all required info - get a message that the account is locked, won't even send password reset.  Today is Thanksgiving, so almost a week without being able to access account.  Just one of many ""inconveniences"" and hassles and annoyances with this bank.  Absolutely gorgeous branches, and I appreciate the lollipops as much as the kids probably do....but how about focusing on being a helpful, useful bank?!?",1,Fairfield County Bank_ChIJd-dLxmugwokRpQ8SNJpB-1U.csv,Jewett City Savings Bank

12/24/2023 04:31:22,Nicole O,"I reviewed Liberty previously but my review vanished mysteriously. Liberty as a business is unethical. I had a checking/savings with them for nearly two decades. After fulfilling my contractual obligation with the local Planet Fitness and cancelling, my cancellation wasn’t processed correctly and the gym continued to bill me for 3 months fraudulently. I cancelled PF in person and because they were swamped at the time, (hence the incorrect processing) they didn’t give me documentation. I called Liberty, explained the situation, and asked the charges to be refunded. The rep immediately sided with the business and told me they couldn’t help me and that they wouldn’t even investigate. So Liberty Bank is in business by making money off of your life’s earnings, but they don’t have your back to protect those earnings when companies steal them fraudulently. Something to consider. Integrity is important. Brick and mortar banks are dated anyway. I cut ties with these guys and I’m making a killing in interest at Ally.",1,Liberty Bank_ChIJVxQitpZK5okR-UqeiQVaYSU.csv,Citizens Bank

Most banks offer the same services. But when you do business with Fairfield County, you feel special and well taken care of.

They provide wonderful services. I recently moved the account of a non profit organization to which I belong from one of the bigger banks to Fairfield County Bank. Wow! It was an easy transition so professionally handled by the Manager, Patty Connelly,  No more monthly management fees, first set of checks, very many, were free, and deposit stamp made free. Where else can you get all these services? Keep up the good job. I am on a mission to tell my friends and family to head to Fairfield County Bank, especially at 255 Tunxis Hill Road, Fairfield, CT 06825. Keep up the great job!

11/20/2020 17:39:18,STACEY H,"My husband and I have been banking with Fairfield County Bank for too many years to count now, and in all those years I must say that this bank is the best banking institution hands down.  We each own businesses and have tried other banks in an effort to keep our personal banking separate from our professional banking but none of them ever came close to the service and dedication that this bank offers.  All of their associates are excellent but if I had to single out an individual who has been a shining star to us, Patricia Connelly, the Manager of the Fairfield Branch comes up first every time!  Recently my husband had his car broken into and they stole important banking information which caused us to have to close and reopen all of our accounts with our banks.  I had been using Fairfield County Bank for family, personal and business for years but my husband was using Chase for his business account at the time.  Chase was so unprofessional during this process causing him to visit the branch several times with a different story of what needed to be done each time.  One phone call to Patty and she had all of the paperwork done for us when we came in, all documents were ready to sign for closing the old account and opening the new ones and the transition seemed almost seamless.  My husband closed his business account with Chase and now we have all of our accounts with Fairfield County Bank.  Thank you Patty, and Fairfield County Bank, for always being there to answer questions and doing such an amazing job for us all these years!!  So glad to know, especially now during COVID, that you are only a phone call away!!",5,Fairfield County Bank_ChIJo3c-o0oO6IkRygNj0ilNA7E.csv,Ion Bank

When we started buying commercial property we immediately went to Virginia for mortgaging.  She was efficient and thorough collecting all the information needed to process and secure mortgages for us.  When she joined Fairfield County Bank, we went to her for a new mortgage, replacing the mortgage we held on a commercial property in Woodbury, CT; a mortgage we are continuing to pay down today.
Through Virginia we met Patricia Connelly, the manager of the Trumbull Branch then, now the Tunxis Hill Branch and the professionalism we found in both of these executives made us very comfortable with the Bank.  We have moved to Florida and continue to bank long distance with the Tunxis Hill Branch.  They are efficient in processing our mail deposits and are courteous and knowledgeable when we call the Branch for information or assistance.
Because of our good and long relationship with the Bank, we have recommended using Fairfield County Bank to numerous friends and colleagues.

06/20/2016 20:07:13,Christine Jones,"I would not recommend Dime Bank to anyone due to their poor service and not caring about their customers.  I had an active checking and savings account for 3 months with weekly direct deposits of $1000+ every Friday.  Then one day the manager calls me and says that they had already closed my accounts and a check would be mailed to my home address.  Before I even had a chance to speak with the manager, Dime Bank had taken upon their decision to do this without my consent or notification prior to this action.  I immediately called them after listening to the manager's voicemail and said that I had a direct deposit coming in the next day and scheduled utility automatic bill payments.
The manager said that there was nothing that they could do since they already closed my accounts.  I requested that they have a check ready for me to pick up later than evening rather than waiting for an unspecified amount of time for it to arrive in the mail.  The manager agreed with my request but my work check was delayed by almost a week since Dime Bank blocked my direct deposit from closing my accounts.
I would never go back to Dime Bank as a customer ever again.  I actually went down the street to get new accounts with a better bank at Charter Oak Credit Union.  Charter Oak has must better customer service, products, and bank related fees.  Charter Oak also has more locations in the areas that I travel through which is definitely more convenient.

When I entered two employees were talking and let me wait without even looking at me. Then one of the ladies came to me and told me she will be with me soon. I was waiting a couple of more minutes than I got seated. I had two questions on that day. The teller treated me like I was completely stupid. She was passive aggressive with all her responses and did not take the time to actually listen to what I was asking. By the time we finished our conversation I was swallowing my tears and left the bank without my issue  resolved. I will never go to that branch again. I hope the Rubber Ave branch will open up and I can go there where I was always treated well.,1,Ion Bank_ChIJ5STdDXzv54kRxD0TEjvoyRM.csv,Newtown Savings Bank
05/19/2018 15:27:36,Sara Gervais,Worst experience I ever had with a bank!!! Would rate zero stars if I could. I had so many problems dealing with the staff that I don’t even know where to start. I requested to have a new card because my current card was under the wrong name since my name changed they said it would take a week or two to come in. I NEVER received a card!! I had to keep using my card with the wrong info on it and I asked numerous times why it was taking so long and they said “must be lost in the mail” like are you serious?? And every time I needed to do a transaction at the bank they gave me attitude that the names didn’t match when it wasn’t even my fault that I didn’t have the correct name on there. Also there was a blonde girl who worked there I have no idea what her problem is but every time she saw me she gave me dirty looks and nothing but attitude. Also a number of times I had to give them “proof” that I was who I say I am because the cards didn’t match (ps. I went there weekly pretty sure they knew who I was)... since they declined to give me a new one and every single transaction they gave me problems because of that. After 8 months of waiting for a new card and countless times requesting one that never came and the staff being hard to deal with I finally closed my account and when I was closing it they mentioned “oh you could have gotten at temporary card”. ....are you serious???? Months of trouble and being stressed out from this and now you mention a temporary card??? Not once of the whole 8 months did they mentioned that to me. I’m so happy I no longer have an account there because it was stressful and difficult to do anything there and their staff has little to none customer service skills and I don’t think they even know how to do their job obviously.

Unfortunately, due to circumstances unresolvable according to GSB the application was mutually cancelled. I had already paid for the application fee and appraisal.

Every single visit i have made to this bank has reinforced my reasoning for remaining a member. The staff were always willing to help, understanding, and very informative. Many even remembered who i was, and went out of their way to make sure that my problems/requests were resolved. I can't give less than 5 stars for the amazing service i received at this small/local bank. The only cons i would have are not related to this business specifically, but rather issues faced by small business banks. I work nights so sleeping during the day makes it hard for me to stop by during open hours (which are limited). And the atm withdrawal limit does mean i suffer some inconvenience when i want to pay in cash.

DR Bank seemed like a good fit as an addition to my much larger major bank.  The first thing I noticed when I walked in was how friendly and welcoming everyone was—the manager, the tellers, everyone made me feel right at home.  Once we got my accounts up and running I was very pleased to see that DR offers the same advanced level of service as the “big bank” with which I was accustomed.  I travel constantly, having reliable online access to banking is important to me, and I have not been disappointed.  By the time of this review I have been a loyal customer for 14 years.  I still enjoy walking in and seeing the staff when I’m in town, who are always happy to greet me, help me, and find out where I’ve been and what I’ve been up to.  By far the best thing to come out of the financial crisis of 2008 was my first visit to DR Bank!",5,DR Bank_ChIJV69KT4egwokRQ-kdaCcpeM4.csv,Ion Bank

I supplied all required documents, but was told there was an issue with my bank account being less than 12 months old and that they would not disperse funds to that account. Considering I've had this account for 10+ years I was confused, but still provided bank statements from more than two years ago.

For the next two weeks my bank account information was ""under review"". I called every 3-4 days for an update and was told ""underwriting is still reviewing but we will know in 24-48 hours"".

Finally after two weeks I called and said I have been waiting for too long and was told they'd have an answer today. My application was denied due to ""bank account not meeting lender requirements"". I then spoke with the manager and supplied her with a document from my bank showing the 10+ year age of the account, and was still denied.
They offered no explanation and only told me to hand write and mail a letter to dispute the claim with underwriting, which considering the past two weeks and attempts to resolve issue would be a waste of my time.

In most of my guidance, it ends in pointing borrowers towards refinancing their student loans through Darien Rowayton Bank for their excellent customer service and incredible rates. DRB has a hidden gem in the fact that they can pay off your student loans, consolidate into a lower payment and interest rate, and allow you to choose your term without a fee.

They do not offer any perks for their customers and their atm machines are outdated, the fees that they charge can also be ridiculous and you are limited to the usage of the ATM'S without getting hit with fees.

I was told once they start kindergarten I can have their accounts changed to get the better interest rate. Well 6 of the 8 made it.  My two younger grandchildren now has to go to the bank and hear them make a speech. Well one of the grandchildren lives in NY so that won’t work. The other 6 grandchildren I just had to tell them that the child turned 5 and is going to kindergarten, now they have to listen to speeches to get a piggy bank.

06/26/2020 19:12:00,Fallon,"Here's the thing: the people at this bank are incredibly nice and do their best to be helpful, but I'm at the end of my rope when it comes to other things that make this a deal breaker.

I've been trying to purchase a computer and have been unable to do so even though I have over $2000 more dollars in the account than is needed to purchase it. The problem is that there's apparently a daily limit you're allowed to spend. Excuse me? It's my money, first of all. I get that fraud protection is important, but I'm talking to them personally telling them it's alright and giving them all my personal information so they've verified it's me, but no one at the bank actually has the ability to allow me to spend my own money. So they have to call an administrator that takes an entire day to get back to them. And then they take at least half a day to get back to me.

So we figure that out. Finally my daily limit has been increased so I can buy this one item. It still doesn't go through. I call them again. Now they're telling me that because the bank the computer store uses is in another state, that's a problem apparently. So I can't buy it until they call the administrator again, tomorrow. And then it'll be the weekend. So at the earliest, I might be able to order the computer next week. Are you kidding me? I'm furious. I'm trying to be fair and reasonable, but this is not fair to me, this is not a good way to run a business, and I don't know how other banks conduct this process, but this is unacceptable for any bank and if I can find another bank to use so that I don't have to go through this again I'm going to switch banks.

This isn't about them protecting me. This is about them protecting themselves and holding onto their money. While the tellers are awesome, the institution itself clearly doesn't care about its patrons. I doubt any bank does, but these practices are totally out of line and I'm done.",2,Northwest Community Bank_ChIJSQkw0cOY54kRJeXuCOCjf0w.csv,Jewett City Savings Bank

I was told to get a calendar by Betsy. Told to remove auto payment from bill pay to prevent overdrafts occurring- when money was just in the wrong account.  Pay my bills manually following a calendar.

Sure that’s viable. But when I am asking what the bank can do to assist me and the first idea they have is adding tasks to my single man business operations. The solution is to find a new bank.  Get out while the getting is good. I’m going to Citizens.

There has to be a system for the bank to pull money from my other accounts or multiple solutions not creating more work for me",1,Essex Savings Bank - Plains Road Branch_ChIJ76sBxLc85okRQRXhfohYfLk.csv,Citizens Bank

Every time I need to call someone to receive assistance I get an automated person that tells me that the bank is closed with absolutely no option to talk to someone even at the higher or cooperate level. I’ve been out of the Connecticut and needed assistance to speak to someone regarding my accounts and their would be no one to answer my questions which is very frustrating. I understand that yes the bank may be closed and everyone may be gone but a bank should definitely have a number to contact (1-800) in case of emergency assistance instead of giving me and option to leave a voicemail.

So I'm screwed if someone did pick up this check and cashes it.  Disclaimer, I don't know if this would be the case at any other bank, but it was the last straw for me, and I will be closing my account.

I would never recommend this bank to any person going into business. I’ve talked to customer care six times to resolve this issue and things are still not resolved at this time. Im appalled that first when I ask for business banking I don’t get transferred directly to them and then find myself in a position where the agent is unable to help me because they are not in business banking. And second The fact that my client has added me to both of his business accounts yet they still need approval to link my online banking to the account. It’s very frustrating. And although everyone I’ve talked to has been very nice at this bank I would never recommend them as they have not resolve the issue still and things have not been efficient at all.,1,Chelsea Groton Bank_ChIJTdRlyJUL5okRuskZ5Yk7xno.csv,Union Savings Bank

12/12/2019 02:09:01,Carlos N.,"When I first started with this bank I was really impressed. The costumer service is great. Peggy and Rachel from the Oxford branch are amazing and kind. HOWEVER, the overdraft forgiveness policy is abismal. My account over-drafted by three times in two days by accident and I was told they can only forgive one of the three and after that they will be no more overdraft forgiveness. On the other hand I know a handful of banks that forgive those if you have a very good reason because these banks understand that sometimes life happens. Can’t say the same about newtown savings bank. I closed my accounts and found a bank that can waive overdrafts and on top of that gives me free ATM anywhere and the fee for overdraft is $29 instead of the $37 I got charged at Newtown. Not that an overdraft will happen again...hopefully. Oh and I almost forgot. The Oxford ATM has a tendency of eating your cash deposits and withdrawals.

The Torringford st branch is exemplary with their service as well as the canton one, however this branch on main st in Torrington has never given me or my mother great service. They are slow, they make you feel as if you are a burden to them, and they are not very customer friendly. I waited in the drive through for 5-8 minutes to be addressed, then another 10 to get my receipt back for depositing a check overall it was 15-20 minute wait. Another time I went the woman just said hello grabbed my deposit slip then went and helped another customer in the middle of my transaction. My mother has also stated that his main st branch is always rude to her as well. Maybe the management there is bringing down their employees or maybe they all just really dont want to be there, but they could learn a thing or two from the wonderful folks at the Torringford branch.

I called them and told me them that it was me using and the card and they said ok we will unlock it. Well they didnt and I had to call them 4 more times to get the card unlocked. Turns out they never did and I had to go to the main bank when I got back and get it taken care of. Iv had other problems with since then, pretty much everytime I call. The most recent thing to happen I had to report my card lost. I called them and asked them to send me another card. They said they were going to and that they put the order in.

02/14/2022 18:57:54,Janet Esposito,"I have been a customer of SBD for the last 23 years. I was very disappointed to see that they do not have the personalized service they once had, which led me to get a couple fees for a transaction that took place in my account. In the past, I would have gotten a call to alert me to a problem that was arising and it would never have gone this far. When I reached out and spoke to the assistant VP, he was very friendly and responsive, but he was not able to fully rectify the situation of reversing both fees when he spoke with a higher up a the bank (he did reverse one fee). It seems like it didn't make any difference that my husband and I have been loyal customers for so many years. It was a real disappointment that the bank did not honor this long standing relationship and take into account the changes that have taken place since the bank has grown in size (i.e., no more  reaching out to let a customer know a problem is arising, which I wasn't aware of until this problem arose).",3,Savings Bank of Danbury_ChIJuUdeG3D_54kRqoWtZSKfkyw.csv,Chelsea Gronto Bank
08/29/2020 23:26:20,Kevin Quigley,"With the exception of the first criticism below, this review is strictly intended for the “new” New Milford branch of Savings Bank of Danbury (“SBD”) and NOT the Kent Road branch near the Big Y.

It seems that while other banks started to relax their rules and allow customers to enter their branches as society began to adjust to COVID—19, SBD - as recently as July (the month of my most recent visit) - maintained a minimal at best access protocol.  The problem, at least from my experience, is that this was not reflected on the main entrance of the branch.  Other banks, such as Webster, displayed signs indicating, “By appointment only.”  People’s United Bank - with social distancing protocols in place - was allowing walk-ins in July.

And now for the “new” New Milford branch (“the ‘new’ NM branch or “the branch”).

I sometimes feel, having watched and listened over the years, that I know more than the person sitting across the desk or standing on the other side of the counter.

I went into the new NM branch on July 13, 2020 to make a deposit to two different accounts.  (Just to note, while I take COVID-19 seriously, I have not encountered any other banks and / or businesses where “once you touch a pen it’s yours.  I walked out with at least two SBD pens that day.)

I was taken inside “as a courtesy” by a gentleman who, I believe, said his name was Jay.  (Note:  Initially, it seemed as though my business was destined to be conducted in the parking lot but I DIDST protest because it was, quite simply, much too hot outside.). Once inside, I dealt with Jay and a young man by the name of Mustafa.  I am not overbearing or a micromanager by any means, but I conveyed from the get go what I was looking to do and watched as my transactions were processed.

To make along story short, this is what transpired upon my exiting the branch but prior to driving off:

I found an error, called the branch, and was told that Jay would come to me.  (We were going to conduct at least some business in that parking lot come **** or high water!).  Upon coming out, Jay said the mistake had already been fixed in the computer but had me “sign the updated sheet anyway.“. And, once again, I got to keep the pen.

At home, I found what I thought to be another error and decided to notify the branch via email.  I called the SBD main number and was told that the branch email was newmilforddanburyrd@sbdanbury.com.  I then sent an email, addressed to Jay and Mustafa, clearly outlining the error.  To this day, I have never heard back from either of them.

I received two pieces of correspondence from SBD revealing that my requests were not correctly fulfilled back in July.

Personally, I am starting to lose faith in SBD (especially since there are so many other banks to choose from with a wider array of account types to choose from).  And I would be more understanding if they were busy that day, but I was the only patron in the branch.

So I went to Union Savings. i LOVE them, the branch Manager knows who i am and remebers me. they also gave me a call to let me know that if you don't pay an over-drafted account i will get charged, unlike Chase who 1) NEVER told me they did the same thing & 2) when I did put money in my account to pay down what i owed them, the next day I  owed them more then B4 I put money in there. The people @ Union Savings are all SUPPER nice & I don't plan on taking my business to another bank till after I move out of CT and i will be sad to leave.

I've been with them for over 4 years, everytime you dispute a transaction no matter if it's $100 or $6 they give you a hard time. Doesn't matter if you say it's fraudulent or not. God forbid you want someone to be blocked from charging your account. (Something ANY bank can do)

From taking up their time to discuss hypothetical loan options on a Saturday with two kids in tow, to small issues within our various accounts that they were quick to fix for us, they are always so patient and eager to help. Most recently, they caught (before we did) an issue with fraud in one of our accounts and worked hard to protect us and keep us safe going forward.

12/08/2021 18:34:04,Jackson Wheeler,READ THIS!!! HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! I wouldn’t give this bank one star. They hit me with $100 of overdraft fees from $90 worth of payments!!! Even with Covid and being sick all of last month there was no way they could overturn the overdraft fees for me. I told them I’m very busy and don’t have time to waste on things like this. They simply kept offering other services to me but I just want my money back!!! On top of this their ATM’s are as old as dirt and probably run off coal!!! I just ordered a card from Varo which doesn’t make you pay overdraft fees and I’m about to close my account here. I was planning on applying for a loan and opening a savings account with them today but they couldn’t help me with this one thing. That goes to show you their level of customer service! I would suggest to try anything else before opening an account here!,1,Liberty Bank_ChIJHWNTPi4O5okReHUAhUXM6IU.csv,Chelsea Gronto Bank

I’m content with the services and reviews at FCB.
Read some reviews of the big banks and you’ll understand why I’m still there.
When you have staffing that stays on their jobs for a longtime, it’s obvious that FCB values their employees too.

09/17/2021 14:35:16,Aofter Liles,"I have been locked out for 2+ weeks.  I spoke with Amy Williams and, besides being very courteous as many are, she was able to help me get back on line.  Although I hope I don't have to go through this hassle again, if I do, I will call Amy to help me through the problems again.  She is highly professional and I thank her again.

On a separate note, it is ridiculous to have a recovery process that takes 2+ weeks and is out of the staff's hands.  That is not in the least customer friendly.  The lockout was my problem through inadvertently responding incorrectly to the login questions.  That happens.  A recovery should be able to be effected immediately upon a phone call and verification.  On another note, your vendor, since I was told the problem was created by the mysterious vendor, is that you cannot automatically make international calls.  I am frequently in France and cannot receive phone calls except by human intervention, e.g. for wire transfers.  It would not be difficult to handle international calls so you would not simply remain a county bank.",5,Fairfield County Bank Operations Center_ChIJ-Wf4Pj-qwokRFc67KzeeLTk.csv,Newtown Savings Bank
