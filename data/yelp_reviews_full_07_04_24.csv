The manager Kim Murphy is in my opinion the best community bank manager out there, or at least within CT. There are 7 offices of NWCB in Litchfield county, and we are under the umbrella of CMHC Connecticut Mutual Holding Company with 2 other community banks - Litchfield Bancorp and Collinsville Savings Society.  

Honestly, a 100% better experience than any commercial or competitor bank, we offer generally competitive and sometimes lower rates, less fees, one-on-one NO-FEE customer service with happy customers.  A much easier and hassle free way of managing personal, and business banking.  

The only pitfall is that we have local ATM's, and restricted locations! Great if you're settled down in the area, but we do accommodate to travel and have dedicated customers throughout the country.","['https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jbtVhnC_jJ1DUpeqM5FPmQ/348s.jpg', 'https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-E1oUmXHMo4f6RQfzcZmwQ/348s.jpg', 'https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/64uXvlX44YjJ_gj6SuGqtA/348s.jpg', 'https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/iZOT103Me1uvA5UoiRIB-g/348s.jpg', 'https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jzSSDNYuKbZjt_c8jn6mBg/348s.jpg', 'https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cX1PPe8mWIfcVpJWzKPrcg/348s.jpg', 'https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/m0q7qR0btEsm76jztjzgSg/348s.jpg', 'https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/sTEJMQGLdEEhpQcLlEbM1w/348s.jpg', 'https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_WBYlfHsQmiTwnX1dOumcA/348s.jpg', 'https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2vi4vFd3H5G79YJdMnJrrQ/348s.jpg']","{'helpful': 0, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 0, 'oh_no': 0}",06/27/2014 03:54:22,1403841262.0,qwm0d6uIjp3gAScC3B3v9g,Joe B.,588.0,5723.0,980.0,"Hartford, CT",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/ZinEmwRHApQCRFFHHqUbSA/180s.jpg,Eaxw-hkE9NiMtrG5DQHpSw,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Eaxw-hkE9NiMtrG5DQHpSw,,,,,,northwest-community-bank-avon_0.csv,Northwest Community Bank

I have had mr overdraft protection since I opened my checking account. There have been times where I needed it since I live on my own, pay Bill's, eat, put oil in the tank to stay warm, gas in my car so I can get to my job, and I was upset and shocked with what just happened. I never recieved a letter from them, even though I was told that they did send a letter that my overdraft privileges were going to be taken away.  I've been with this bank for over 10 years and my family has been banking with them for over 20 years. 
I called them today because I couldn't use my card for medicine. When I called them I was told that the person in charge would have to call me back because they were on the phone. When they called me back I was told that my account was in the negative for 30 days which is impossible because I get paid every two weeks. I was also told that I went over my overdraft last week in which I put in a stop payment which never happened. My account has been in the positive for the last two weeks.

Banks were giving loans left and right, along with toasters in many cases, and it seems that the only requirement to get a huge mortgage was that you have a pulse.  Even that was waived in some cases.

Unless, you actually had a job and needed to finish building a house.  In that case, no-one would consider lending you the money.  Ours was not a big extravagant house, it was modest, but we needed some more things, like drywall, plumbing fixtures, etc.

After calling just about every bank we could think off, we finally hit upon the bright idea of calling our local bank, and who would have thought?  They gave us the loan, along with decent customer service, convenient hours and several branches.

The loan is now paid and the house is still there.

-No minimum balance
-$100 bonus if you attach a direct deposit
-Refund of other banks' ATM fees at the end of the billing cycle
-A solid online banking system with bill pay and phone app
-One free bank check per month
-Free MasterCard debit
-A really good ATM with envelope-free deposits

https://www.yelp.com/biz/thomaston-savings-bank-bristol-2?osq=Thomaston Savings Bank,Thomaston Savings Bank,2.0,"Despite what *could* be the most convenient bank I ever had, over the last six years I've shared a neighborhood with this bank, we've had a bit of a rocky start.

The first two times I visited the bank, I needed something notarized. I was told to take a seat and I would be helped. Despite no additional customers entering the bank between the time I entered and the entire time I waited, I was left sitting for over 20 minutes. Feeling abandoned and forgotten both times, I went to the UPS store across the street. I now don't bother considering Thomaston Savings Bank for my notary needs. Most recently, I came in, wearing my work uniform, with one dollar and asked for 2 rolls of pennies. Nothing crazy, just 2 rolls. Why did I ask for these rolls? Because the manager at my workplace was on vacation and left us without pennies by mistake. Since Thomaston Savings Bank is very close to my workplace, and because it's even closer to home, I figured I'd stop by on my way to work. I didn't even get to explain the importance of my work emergency (and how my work's bank is the next town over and how I have no vehicle or way to get there), because I was sternly informed that was a service for their customers only. It was disheartening, considering how they *seem* like a community bank, and how a request for 2 rolls of pennies in an extenuating circumstance is an extremely low risk transaction, with an opportunity to gain both a new customer, and let the person know that Thomaston Savings Bank is a helpful member of the community. 

These three experiences caused me to no longer consider starting a relationship with this bank, despite how temptingly close it is to my home, despite how fancy the atm machine is, nor how bright and welcoming the facility seems. It's kinda a shame, but I don't like feeling ignored and turned away by my community bank.

In the end, another bank in the area happily exchanged my dollar for 2 rolls of pennies. So it's not like a bank *couldn't* do it for a non-customer, it's just Thomaston Savings Bank *won't* do it for a non-customer.",[],"{'helpful': 0, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 0, 'oh_no': 0}",04/11/2022 07:10:07,1649661007.0,ATWl7k01aNViTryQXlGQsQ,Mel B.,44.0,136.0,122.0,"Bristol, CT",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/zoZivo8nHFqoPm4S1bmhQw/180s.jpg,b2FuA9zF7b0JCHuBBgKsBg,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=b2FuA9zF7b0JCHuBBgKsBg,,,,,,thomaston-savings-bank-bristol-2_1.csv,Thomaston Savings Bank

It's actually better and cheaper and safer to stop banking there altogether and get a PayPal account which has less fees and is more progressive. They eventually unblocked the card for me for 24 hours. So wait, I can use my own money? That's just unreal. Dear Union Savings Bank Corporate, If you're having problems with fraud overseas you need to build a robust security system, not limit the usage of your customers money. And more importantly, not ask customers to come in a branch and sign a release. That makes no sense. What if The customer was actually in Canada?

Called again and basically told them ""why would come to bank the next day, cancel my card, get a new one, then the same day we get back from vacation go to the bank to fill out paperwork.

However, two weeks ago I tried to deposit a check I received from my aunt and three days later my mobile and online banking accounts were locked. I called in and was told they were going to look into it and get back to me in 3 business days. During this time my aunt had taken out the money and given me the money in cash to deposit. I never tried to resubmit the check after that but still couldn't access my account. A week passed with no return call and I received a letter saying they couldn't accept the check and were deducting a $15 fee. I call back and am told to wait again. I receive a call 20 minutes later telling me my account is pending closing because it looks like I tried to deposit a fake check so I can either go to a local branch or wait to receive the official paperwork. I packed up my newborn and went down to the bank where the lady working at the time was very helpful and assisted me in pleading my case, however, despite her trying to fight it for 20 minutes, she informed me that the call had already been made to close my account and that all she could do was destroy my debit card and withdraw all my money. 10 years, since I was 16 with no incidents and this is what I get in return. The craziest part is that my mother also received a check from the same aunt and deposited it the same day only for it to bounce and her to have to deposit the cash she gave her yet no action has been taken against her account.
