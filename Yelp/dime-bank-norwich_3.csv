( ridiculous!) the recording automatically puts you in a "" so called ""q"" then proceeding to tell you what call you are & your wait time!!!  well .... the 1st time i was caller #2 w wait time of 8 minutes (again ridiculous) 2nd time i was caller #6 w wait time of 14 minutes... 3rd & last time i was caller # 9 w wait time of 25 minutes!!! i felt as though i was calling a radio station to win concert tickets ... but w this bank you dont win anything!!! it was urgent that i speak w an employee as my debit card was stolen & it was being used racking up astronomical chargers in the meantime!!! dime bank is the worst bank ive ever dealt with.....never again!! after all the problems i had entailed with this ""unprofessional "" business i was done with them!!! so unacceptable & very unprofessional!!!",[],"{'helpful': 0, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 0, 'oh_no': 0}",12/03/2022 09:30:20,1670059820,EIKi6FUeF_bWSlPOvEQ3eA,Mary M.,0,0,8,"Lisbon, CT",,FsTOdZhmNqhym044yqxk5A,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=FsTOdZhmNqhym044yqxk5A,,,,,
