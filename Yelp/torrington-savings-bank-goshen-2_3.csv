https://www.yelp.com/biz/torrington-savings-bank-goshen-2?osq=Torrington Savings Bank,Torrington Savings Bank,4,"The Torrington Savings Bank office in Goshen is a nice location; they have a fair amount of parking, picnic table in the back, and a drive up ATM and teller. When it was originally being built, I found the TV ads showing the plowed up landscape under the voice-over touting their rock solid foundation in Litchfield County ironically hilarious. Now, the interior is a pretty marble so they have that solid footing, I suppose. The tellers and employees have always been very nice. The only constant negative: there is a speed bump/drainage line from Heck between the bank and the parking lot for the post office/liquor store. Seriously, whoever approved it must have a financial interest in a local autobody shop. Save your front end, and if you need to go from parking lot to the other, just go back on the road and turn that way.",['https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/013ae063s0gcXrZk2thjeg/348s.jpg'],"{'helpful': 11, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 11, 'oh_no': 0}",01/04/2022 15:48:00,1641311280,7EEzK_XqKYv_t4E5kn-uBA,Tricia B.,1399,12997,1134,"Litchfield, CT",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/vRpjc3QQQvKTXkILwg5tbA/180s.jpg,p9vAOd-h58DhUBgIVwSqKg,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=p9vAOd-h58DhUBgIVwSqKg,,,,,
