https://www.yelp.com/biz/jewett-city-savings-bank-plainfield?osq=Jewett City Savings Bank,Jewett City Savings Bank,1,"so I have been a customer at this bank for twenty years and I needed a student loan payment stopped (which was never supposed to be drafted but that another yelp review). The Dept of Education said so sorry our bad but because it is drafted and due to come out tomorrow there is nothing we can do to stop it. They recommended I call my bank and have them stop the draft payment. I did and was told that JCSB would charge me $30.00 to ""attempt"" to stop the payment but if it came in tonight hey they would be unable to stop it but they would till keep my $30. I am in tears right now because my mortgage payment is going to bounce because of this. So my choice is take the hit and let them pull the $265 or pay 30 and maybe end up paying 295.00 The girl on the phone tried to help but apparently the bank manager at this branch refused to waive the fee. Thanks for making my life worse during the Covid19 pandemic. I wont forget how you treat your long time customers and when this is over. not only will I switch banks but I am going to tell every single person I know and plenty of strangers that this bank does not care about its customers during the worst crisis this country has seen in 100 years.",[],"{'helpful': 0, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 0, 'oh_no': 0}",04/15/2020 19:26:15,1586978775,ZVLitnOGSTBwKSfJjNy11w,Shelley S.,0,0,1,"Plainfield, CT",,9yxeVyh6j9Ql-mdoyXVkEg,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=9yxeVyh6j9Ql-mdoyXVkEg,,,,,
