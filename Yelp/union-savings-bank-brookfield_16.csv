https://www.yelp.com/biz/union-savings-bank-brookfield?osq=Union Savings Bank,Union Savings Bank,1,"Been banking with Union Savings for over 30 years & I love the bank.
But today, at the Brookfield Branch by Costco--experienced the nastiest, most unfriendly tellers ever! I'm a bookkeeper so I bank quite frequently and for multi-million dollar companies. No one was in the bank, so I wanted 2 different tellers to process my deposits from a non-profit so I could get in & out quicker. One had the nerve to say ""Well if a customer comes in, I'll have to stop yours (deposit)""
Ok--and what am I??? Not a customer? Lucky for me there are many other branches, because I won't be back there again! Two words--Mean Girls! (They also deposited my paycheck and would not let me see my running bank balance. Oh yeah-to them I'm not a customer.)",[],"{'helpful': 0, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 0, 'oh_no': 0}",01/06/2017 15:49:42,1483717782,mzzd-NevLcs7nTdmfX0LgQ,Linda Q.,1,0,51,"Brookfield, CT",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/PykyqqJun0RfBeuVAmib7A/180s.jpg,jZFHgwkgMGDKko1vx6Kcmg,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=jZFHgwkgMGDKko1vx6Kcmg,,,,,
