I needed a certain seal for some papers, I was told it would cost me $ 20.00 and I had to show probate papers and death certificate which really had me wondering why. I went to People's United where I have another account and they did what I needed with just a ID and no charge .  Union savings bank is not what it use to be. I will be looking into changing banks",[],"{'helpful': 0, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 0, 'oh_no': 0}",03/17/2018 04:12:20,1521259940,uyxpalXQi-u8MCiYjUznxg,R M.,0,0,1,"Southbury, CT",,dnOYmNgGa4pLXkiU0S7Pgw,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=dnOYmNgGa4pLXkiU0S7Pgw,,,,,
