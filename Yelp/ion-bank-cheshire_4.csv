https://www.yelp.com/biz/ion-bank-cheshire?osq=Ion Bank,Ion Bank,1,very poor service and lack of communication. This bank also seems to be stuck in the 1990s. Forcing people to come in person (which for someone with 2 babies is not the easiest) when other banks are changing to cater their clients needs Ion continues to drop the ball. In person is a long and slow experience with people unable to properly do their job which speaks volumes on a complete lack of training. The mortgage department also fails to listen to their clients needs and choose their own dates for when payments are processed. I strongly suggest choosing other mortgage brokers before Ion Bank.,[],"{'helpful': 0, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 0, 'oh_no': 0}",12/02/2023 16:00:50,1701532850,1okYLS1Gf1sCo5bAgSLFbw,Josh M.,0,0,3,"CT, CT",,cIaSRRLtzmr1v0GRRh7ppQ,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=cIaSRRLtzmr1v0GRRh7ppQ,,,,,
