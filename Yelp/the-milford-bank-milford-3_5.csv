I opened an account with Milford Bank years ago and have been happy with them ever since. They have a wide variety of locations, great hours, friendly staff, online banking and now mobile banking. I am very happy with their service and feel like they actually appreciate their customers!!!",[],"{'helpful': 1, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 0, 'oh_no': 0}",07/24/2012 21:52:22,1343166742,uzw2hXeMSHeFCc7m02WgWA,Karen T.,5,1,17,"Milford, CT",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/Osb8CM42bLG_d3T9STv92A/180s.jpg,uJjIXahIlKlztScIRimgGw,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=uJjIXahIlKlztScIRimgGw,,,,,
