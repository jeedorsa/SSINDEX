https://www.yelp.com/biz/liberty-bank-plainville?osq=Liberty Bank,Liberty Bank,1,"Liberty bank was fine until they outsourced their online banking in Dec-Jan.  Since then all my payment dates have been moved, they have lost 4 payments so far and insist on charging for stop check fees.  Some payees that got paid in 3 days are not seeing checks for 3 weeks.
What a horrible experience!  I have spent countless hours trying to make sure my bills are not paid late.  This use to be a descent bank, now it is useless.",[],"{'helpful': 0, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 0, 'oh_no': 0}",03/14/2018 21:30:13,1521063013,T6jgZEYIJia9OpSEz6K6Zw,Thom S.,1,0,6,"Plainville, CT",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/VPTREdXDEuZuUeDWdWCayQ/180s.jpg,7Z1xN1SlW69a_CTudpZk4A,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=7Z1xN1SlW69a_CTudpZk4A,,,,,

I gave them 4 stars because the ATM is clunky slow and old. Other than that I love the website it does more then my previous bank and checks clear very quickly.,[],"{'helpful': 0, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 0, 'oh_no': 0}",09/23/2019 16:26:16,1569255976,9E8Q5qLWaKeolkZnlJqaNw,Susan P.,0,0,39,"Palm Harbor, FL",,eahT61EBnixRwz2UHYrsFA,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=eahT61EBnixRwz2UHYrsFA,,,,,
