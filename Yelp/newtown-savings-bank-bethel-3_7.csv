https://www.yelp.com/biz/newtown-savings-bank-bethel-3?osq=Newtown Savings Bank,Newtown Savings Bank,1,Worst customer service. The agent I was assigned to help with our mortgage was very unprofessional. I called him on July 4th for making an offer on a house. I had to called him two more times that day and every time he answered in a rude way since he had a family gathering. With last call he yell d at me that I am using him and wasting his time and that he doesn't want to hear from me again. Family gathering and holidays are important but if someone takes a job that involves answering to customers on a holiday they should expect that. I was never treated that badly as a customer in any other bank.,[],"{'helpful': 1, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 1, 'oh_no': 0}",07/10/2021 01:44:29,1625881469,iMSm-u-xOQDlg2vCeZ6f4A,Payam M.,0,0,1,"Memphis, TN",,E6DLMMBzI06dkZXtvjRFmw,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=E6DLMMBzI06dkZXtvjRFmw,,,,,

This bank no longer reviews its client base.  I requested an increase to pay a bill.  I have more than enough in my business account to cover nor had I bounced a check written from my account.  But, because a customer bounced a check causing my deposit to bounce 2x, the bank refused.  So, this bank is unfriendly towards small businesses as most investment banks are.  It's all about their bottom line and to hell with how long you have done business with them and how well your credit is. I recommend you find another savings and loan or credit union bank as I am doing.",[],"{'helpful': 0, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 0, 'oh_no': 0}",11/09/2020 19:52:46,1604951566,KXSYi_Um83vrxk-GrFt8xQ,Just Another M.,0,0,4,"Trumbull, CT",,mKUBFCOuaLb7wNwV_Hj5cQ,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=mKUBFCOuaLb7wNwV_Hj5cQ,,,,,

But as far as internet bank and the phone apps, they are atleast 10 years behind everyone else. No other bank (including local banks) take 2-3 days and hours of work just to set up external bank to bank transfer, as well as no other bank offers mobile deposits but require you to get approval to do mobile deposits.
