https://www.yelp.com/biz/thomaston-savings-bank-bristol-2?osq=Thomaston Savings Bank,Thomaston Savings Bank,2,"Despite what *could* be the most convenient bank I ever had, over the last six years I've shared a neighborhood with this bank, we've had a bit of a rocky start.

The first two times I visited the bank, I needed something notarized. I was told to take a seat and I would be helped. Despite no additional customers entering the bank between the time I entered and the entire time I waited, I was left sitting for over 20 minutes. Feeling abandoned and forgotten both times, I went to the UPS store across the street. I now don't bother considering Thomaston Savings Bank for my notary needs. Most recently, I came in, wearing my work uniform, with one dollar and asked for 2 rolls of pennies. Nothing crazy, just 2 rolls. Why did I ask for these rolls? Because the manager at my workplace was on vacation and left us without pennies by mistake. Since Thomaston Savings Bank is very close to my workplace, and because it's even closer to home, I figured I'd stop by on my way to work. I didn't even get to explain the importance of my work emergency (and how my work's bank is the next town over and how I have no vehicle or way to get there), because I was sternly informed that was a service for their customers only. It was disheartening, considering how they *seem* like a community bank, and how a request for 2 rolls of pennies in an extenuating circumstance is an extremely low risk transaction, with an opportunity to gain both a new customer, and let the person know that Thomaston Savings Bank is a helpful member of the community. 

These three experiences caused me to no longer consider starting a relationship with this bank, despite how temptingly close it is to my home, despite how fancy the atm machine is, nor how bright and welcoming the facility seems. It's kinda a shame, but I don't like feeling ignored and turned away by my community bank.

In the end, another bank in the area happily exchanged my dollar for 2 rolls of pennies. So it's not like a bank *couldn't* do it for a non-customer, it's just Thomaston Savings Bank *won't* do it for a non-customer.",[],"{'helpful': 0, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 0, 'oh_no': 0}",04/11/2022 07:10:07,1649661007,ATWl7k01aNViTryQXlGQsQ,Mel B.,44,136,122,"Bristol, CT",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/zoZivo8nHFqoPm4S1bmhQw/180s.jpg,b2FuA9zF7b0JCHuBBgKsBg,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=b2FuA9zF7b0JCHuBBgKsBg,,,,,
