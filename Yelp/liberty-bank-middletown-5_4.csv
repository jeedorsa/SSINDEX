https://www.yelp.com/biz/liberty-bank-middletown-5?osq=Liberty Bank,Liberty Bank,1,"Been a Liberty Bank customer for decades. Also a TD Bank customer. Decided to move some money from TD Bank to Liberty Bank, so I had TD Bank wire over a significant deposit to Liberty. Liberty had the nerve to charge a $10 fee for the incoming deposit. Went to the branch I've used for decades. They said they can't reverse fees, but to call the Liberty line. The first Liberty line representative said she'd get back to me on reversing the fee within a couple of days. Weeks later, she never called back. The representative I spoke with today said that fees are in the updated disclosure documents and he will not reverse it. If Liberty Bank is so eager to charge fees that they are now charging for deposits, I will certainly take my deposits and my banking to TD Bank. Liberty Bank is not what it was years ago. I'd advise you to consider the fees very carefully before you choose to bank with Liberty Bank.",[],"{'helpful': 0, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 0, 'oh_no': 0}",02/25/2024 15:12:56,1708873976,u79XaV0v90hnmW8twzlBlQ,D M.,0,0,1,"Middletown, CT",,K3-dsZYzJ0ep3vaQLmgXGQ,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=K3-dsZYzJ0ep3vaQLmgXGQ,,,,,

https://www.yelp.com/biz/liberty-bank-middletown-5?osq=Liberty Bank,Liberty Bank,1,"Liberty Bank contacted ME (again they contacted ME) that there might be some fraudulent charges on our debit card. We checked and there were totaling about $160. One was for a raffle for cookware another from a gym membership and another for a VPN account. The next day we went to the bank and cancelled the card and got a replacement. They bank could not do anything with the transactions at the time because they were ""Pending"" We left the next day for vacation and returned a week later and went to the bank to fill out the fraudulent claim paperwork. Approximately 10 days later we received letters saying they were valid transactions. We then called Liberty and they said they would send us the docs involved in them calling valid transactions. Never got them. Called again and basically told them ""why would come to bank the next day, cancel my card, get a new one, then the same day we get back from vacation go to the bank to fill out paperwork. For my health? So Liberty Bank is relying on some fraudulent data they got instead of an life long customer. Unfortunately Liberty is the only bank in my town and if there was one called Joe's Bank or Not safe Bank I would pull my accounts in a minute. All the good this bank fid for me over the past 50 years went away when they believe some fraudulent person and not a life long customer.

However, two weeks ago I tried to deposit a check I received from my aunt and three days later my mobile and online banking accounts were locked. I called in and was told they were going to look into it and get back to me in 3 business days. During this time my aunt had taken out the money and given me the money in cash to deposit. I never tried to resubmit the check after that but still couldn't access my account. A week passed with no return call and I received a letter saying they couldn't accept the check and were deducting a $15 fee. I call back and am told to wait again. I receive a call 20 minutes later telling me my account is pending closing because it looks like I tried to deposit a fake check so I can either go to a local branch or wait to receive the official paperwork. I packed up my newborn and went down to the bank where the lady working at the time was very helpful and assisted me in pleading my case, however, despite her trying to fight it for 20 minutes, she informed me that the call had already been made to close my account and that all she could do was destroy my debit card and withdraw all my money. 10 years, since I was 16 with no incidents and this is what I get in return. The craziest part is that my mother also received a check from the same aunt and deposited it the same day only for it to bounce and her to have to deposit the cash she gave her yet no action has been taken against her account.
