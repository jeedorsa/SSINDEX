https://www.yelp.com/biz/liberty-bank-simsbury?osq=Liberty Bank,Liberty Bank,1,"Liberty Bank contacted ME (again they contacted ME) that there might be some fraudulent charges on our debit card. We checked and there were totaling about $160. One was for a raffle for cookware another from a gym membership and another for a VPN account. The next day we went to the bank and cancelled the card and got a replacement. They bank could not do anything with the transactions at the time because they were ""Pending"" We left the next day for vacation and returned a week later and went to the bank to fill out the fraudulent claim paperwork. Approximately 10 days later we received letters saying they were valid transactions. We then called Liberty and they said they would send us the docs involved in them calling valid transactions. Never got them. Called again and basically told them ""why would come to bank the next day, cancel my card, get a new one, then the same day we get back from vacation go to the bank to fill out paperwork. For my health? So Liberty Bank is relying on some fraudulent data they got instead of an life long customer. Unfortunately Liberty is the only bank in my town and if there was one called Joe's Bank or Not safe Bank I would pull my accounts in a minute. All the good this bank fid for me over the past 50 years went away when they believe some fraudulent person and not a life long customer.
