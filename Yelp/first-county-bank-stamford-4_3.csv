First year, they didn`t send me the 1098 form. Second year, even though I`m on auto pay and I pay my mortgage and escrow on time all the time, they failed to pay my real estate tax. I found out after I received a late payment letter from the city with penalty and interest. I left massages to the bank escrow department but nobody called back until I called the original mortgage person Jennifer whom I dealt with at first. She took action and I got an email from the escrow department that they had a system error and they are paying the tax now: after 2.5 months it was due and after the city said that they will put a lien on my property if I don`t pay withing 3 days. The worst bank ever!!! If you want to avoid stress, DO NOT EVER get mortgage from them!

I would give that aspect of my experience 5 stars. However, the problem with First County now is they seem to be nickeling and diming their customers to death. They're tacking fees onto everything and when I voiced my concern to the manager - his response was basically, this is the way it is.  Direct deposit at other banks entitle you to a free checking account.  This is not the case with FC as now, there's a $6 fee, plus a minimum balance must be maintained.  I've shopped around and after many years with First County, I've jumped ship to a not so ""fee happy"" bank.  I've found a bank with a totally free checking account, no minimum balance required...and after 2 direct deposits in 60 days received a $100 gift deposit from the bank!  Do your research - there are better banks out there!",[],"{'helpful': 1, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 0, 'oh_no': 0}",09/01/2014 15:09:11,1409584151,Kp92E-4wMfDZiWVA9yzEHw,Terri M.,0,1,26,"Darien, CT",,ErzX8Fbtw9DV0FriFunw9Q,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ErzX8Fbtw9DV0FriFunw9Q,,,,,
