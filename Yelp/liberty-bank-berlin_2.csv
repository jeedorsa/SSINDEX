https://www.yelp.com/biz/liberty-bank-berlin?osq=Liberty Bank,Liberty Bank,1,"Liberty Bank contacted ME (again they contacted ME) that there might be some fraudulent charges on our debit card. We checked and there were totaling about $160. One was for a raffle for cookware another from a gym membership and another for a VPN account. The next day we went to the bank and cancelled the card and got a replacement. They bank could not do anything with the transactions at the time because they were ""Pending"" We left the next day for vacation and returned a week later and went to the bank to fill out the fraudulent claim paperwork. Approximately 10 days later we received letters saying they were valid transactions. We then called Liberty and they said they would send us the docs involved in them calling valid transactions. Never got them. Called again and basically told them ""why would come to bank the next day, cancel my card, get a new one, then the same day we get back from vacation go to the bank to fill out paperwork. For my health? So Liberty Bank is relying on some fraudulent data they got instead of an life long customer. Unfortunately Liberty is the only bank in my town and if there was one called Joe's Bank or Not safe Bank I would pull my accounts in a minute. All the good this bank fid for me over the past 50 years went away when they believe some fraudulent person and not a life long customer.

As was true of TD back then, I will remain cautiously optimistic about Liberty for now. But for the past month, they've been pretty spankin' fantastic. That BreakFree checking account they've got has pretty much everything you could ask for:

-No minimum balance
-$100 bonus if you attach a direct deposit
-Refund of other banks' ATM fees at the end of the billing cycle
-A solid online banking system with bill pay and phone app
-One free bank check per month
-Free MasterCard debit
-A really good ATM with envelope-free deposits

We even got a hand-written card from our banker just yesterday. Yeah, it's a bit of a marketing gimmick, but nevertheless proof that they aren't one of those banks that's too big to fail, or too big to treat people like people.",[],"{'helpful': 2, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 3, 'oh_no': 0}",11/30/2013 23:25:42,1385853942,i_sqE77ZzT9D3D3iQzAKsg,Jason M.,120,25,1080,"Berlin, CT",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/YfM85ksSRNC12vQVfl62sw/180s.jpg,YpQeAaEP0iIhXcg3ZW7vBA,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=YpQeAaEP0iIhXcg3ZW7vBA,,,,,

Convenient  hours are such a huge plus for a bank, open Saturdays until 3, and open later into the evenings as well.
