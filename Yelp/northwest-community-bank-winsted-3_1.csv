We have been with NWC for more than 40 years and have never seen such behavior with any of the branches. NWC is a great community bank they serve the community with all banking service and more.  They even look at your accounts daily, and will call you if there is unusual activity!  They are friendly, and are part of the community. They do many charitable events for the community. They are there for your major financial events in life, and daily needs. I would go on a vacation with any one of them!  Thank You Northwest Community Bank!
