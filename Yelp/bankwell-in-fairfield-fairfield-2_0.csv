I called on 6.23.17 and from the initial representative to the banker who did not even introduce himself or great me with a simple hello but instead he stated he would need to take a message and pass it on to another department. When I asked if I should call at a different time or another number he replied no he would just need to have someone call back,? I instead hung up on him.",[],"{'helpful': 0, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 0, 'oh_no': 0}",06/23/2017 14:01:42,1498226502,D4wKSVgGK_8i5LsRI5VGhg,Tom L.,0,1,26,"Stamford, CT",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/FVU58O7paShtDTfJvRJvrA/180s.jpg,uVPP4bMvuA-zCH5Ci-bfsg,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=uVPP4bMvuA-zCH5Ci-bfsg,,,,,

First of all I walked in and the man behind the counter was so energetic and so pleasant, I've never had a banking experience quite like that. He introduced me to another gentleman in the office and was very very patient and kind. He just seemed like he was happy about life and it put me a really good mood! I live about 20 minutes south from this particular branch but I will go out of my way to come here instead of going somewhere closer because of how friendly they were.
