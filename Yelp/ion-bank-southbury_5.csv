https://www.yelp.com/biz/ion-bank-southbury?osq=Ion Bank,Ion Bank,1,Was in drive up teller at 3:55 and when I got up at 4:01 because there was 2 people in front of me I was greeted by a snotty teller that insisted I wasn't there because she could see in her mirror.   Then extremely sarcastic when the checks were made out to my children and I signed them.  Obviously a toddler can't sign a check. The attitude and sarcasm was unnecessary.

On the rare occasion that I've had an issue, it has been handled quickly easily and satisfactorily. They make everything so easy. This is the same type of service that I have enjoyed with small banks and credit unions I've used previously. My only regret is that now that I'm moving out of state they do not have branches there. I highly recommend them and would again mention their excellent customer service throughout all branches and service levels!!",[],"{'helpful': 0, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 0, 'oh_no': 0}",08/03/2018 23:46:55,1533340015,6bTxqEiHqb1mp87nuuPy9A,Lucinda S.,0,0,5,"Port Richey, FL",,BnnIRet4hf0B1RwVmgSMLA,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=BnnIRet4hf0B1RwVmgSMLA,,,,,
