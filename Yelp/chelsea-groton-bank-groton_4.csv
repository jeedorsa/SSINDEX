I had to talk to someone who speaks so low you can't even hear them. Then to cash a check you have to put it in the machine and let then look at it first (it's their check) but when you ask a question about it the rep (Rafey) talks so low you can't hear him. I don't feel comfortable dealing with someone you can't hear.
Is Chelsea Groton Bank really eliminating talking to tellers face to face? If so don't put a machine next to a busy road so the cars driving by are louder than the rep with an attitude. When I called the main number to ask where there is an actual bank with people the little girl Kaylee (voice sounded like a little girl trying to act cutesy) said water street in mystic. I'm not going to downtown Mystic full of tourists this time of year to cash a check.
Guess I never use that bank again. Just another bank cutting cost's and customer service at the same time.",[],"{'helpful': 0, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 0, 'oh_no': 0}",04/14/2023 15:51:17,1681487477,pWOP6bvZJ33A3yMfREDw1Q,Concerned C.,0,3,8,"Charlestown, RI",,zbineGFaTeVIiLuFvxKcWw,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=zbineGFaTeVIiLuFvxKcWw,"Thank you for your feedback.  Our Mystic Auto branch is equipped with “live tellers” onsite; they can be found on the inside lane closest to the building.  The two outside lanes are drive up VBMs (Virtual banking ATMs) which provide our customers with the ability to bank 24/7, customers can also speak with a banker through video technology up to 7 pm at night which is very convenient.

We will reach out to our digital banking team to see if there’s a way to turn up the volume so that our customers can hear the conversation better. 

We're sorry that your experience using our drive-up virtual banking ATMs was not to your satisfaction, we take all feedback seriously and use it as an opportunity to improve.",Chelsea Groton Bank,04/14/2023 16:59:16,1681491556.0,

https://www.yelp.com/biz/chelsea-groton-bank-groton?osq=Chelsea Groton Bank,Chelsea Groton Bank,1,"I've been banking with Chelsea Groton for over 10 years now and today I had the worst customer experience ever. I have had mr overdraft protection since I opened my checking account. There have been times where I needed it since I live on my own, pay Bill's, eat, put oil in the tank to stay warm, gas in my car so I can get to my job, and I was upset and shocked with what just happened. I never recieved a letter from them, even though I was told that they did send a letter that my overdraft privileges were going to be taken away.  I've been with this bank for over 10 years and my family has been banking with them for over 20 years. 
I called them today because I couldn't use my card for medicine. When I called them I was told that the person in charge would have to call me back because they were on the phone. When they called me back I was told that my account was in the negative for 30 days which is impossible because I get paid every two weeks. I was also told that I went over my overdraft last week in which I put in a stop payment which never happened. My account has been in the positive for the last two weeks. I was then told that I can put a request in to get my overdraft privileges back but that is no guarantee, its reviewed. I was disappointed that after 10 years or so of being a checking account holder I was treated like this. I have always pit money back into my checking account, and never has it been an issue until now.",[],"{'helpful': 0, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 0, 'oh_no': 0}",04/15/2019 15:36:50,1555342610,gfKgVnhkHpI7ObIJG9YB0Q,Nick V.,145,0,1,"Gales Ferry, Ledyard, CT",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/Uo_cx-HEaox0SpjSk9AblQ/180s.jpg,rGoH5_azN_kZP0FTeUtDZg,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=rGoH5_azN_kZP0FTeUtDZg,,,,,
https://www.yelp.com/biz/chelsea-groton-bank-groton?osq=Chelsea Groton Bank,Chelsea Groton Bank,4,"Once upon a time, there was plenty of money to go around.  Banks were giving loans left and right, along with toasters in many cases, and it seems that the only requirement to get a huge mortgage was that you have a pulse.  Even that was waived in some cases.

Unless, you actually had a job and needed to finish building a house.  In that case, no-one would consider lending you the money.  Ours was not a big extravagant house, it was modest, but we needed some more things, like drywall, plumbing fixtures, etc.

After calling just about every bank we could think off, we finally hit upon the bright idea of calling our local bank, and who would have thought?  They gave us the loan, along with decent customer service, convenient hours and several branches.

The loan is now paid and the house is still there.

The free money party, however, is now over.

Moral of the story:  try your local bank first.",['https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bdN5bdq0hSvAXQe4PUp0eQ/348s.jpg'],"{'helpful': 3, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 1, 'oh_no': 0}",06/11/2010 04:09:02,1276229342,-iqzbaZV4VfdZl4EWbj2Mg,Romulo R.,146,520,415,"Boston, MA",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/cQ_6n52B23lJ_9nSpk1_EA/180s.jpg,DWHDoQ3yWpC71kuDFnsO7Q,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=DWHDoQ3yWpC71kuDFnsO7Q,,,,,
