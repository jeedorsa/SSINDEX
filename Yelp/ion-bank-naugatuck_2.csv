https://www.yelp.com/biz/ion-bank-naugatuck?osq=Ion Bank,Ion Bank,1,This is for the rubber ave location in Naugatuck. Terrible service. Came in on Saturday the 15th around 10am just to get a replacement card and I've been sitting here for an hour and a half now looking at people sitting behind the glass doing nothing. When a cashier went over and said something to the people who do the cards he was told they are busy yet I'm looking at them do nothing. Unbelievable. Time for a new bank.,[],"{'helpful': 0, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 0, 'oh_no': 0}",02/15/2020 16:30:08,1581784208,ROUFGP0FsUiQVhwzjQYlAQ,Kristina P.,0,1,24,"Meriden, CT",,k-zQHd1Izan1mWvW3cJrxw,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=k-zQHd1Izan1mWvW3cJrxw,,,,,

https://www.yelp.com/biz/ion-bank-naugatuck?osq=Ion Bank,Ion Bank,1,"Absolutely the worst bank since the switch. Worst customer service, and to cash a check they required my SS number which is technically illegal and irrelevant. My family has had Naugatuck Savings for over 30 years with multiple mortages through the bank. Needless to say they are switching to a different bank since they sold out. While inside the branch, there were around 6 or 7 people waiting for service, 5 of which were having account issues. I can't imagine they will last very long operating like this. Save yourself the trouble, go somewhere else.",[],"{'helpful': 0, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 0, 'oh_no': 0}",08/13/2015 20:27:35,1439497655,X0Zl-huhIAmwSxI-rvUtFw,Scott F.,80,0,1,"Waterbury, CT",,sES0J_rgmcFuUQa6r7eujQ,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=sES0J_rgmcFuUQa6r7eujQ,,,,,
