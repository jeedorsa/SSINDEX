She was very thorough and answered all of our questions. She took time to sit with us and explained everything. I later visited a couple days later to open a business checking account. 

I can't express how great the personal one-on-one service  was - and it is so important. We never had this great of an experience with Chase or Citibank. We're so happy we're banking with Union Savings Bank now. Thanks, Darcy!",[],"{'helpful': 0, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 0, 'oh_no': 0}",09/19/2023 17:20:23,1695144023,GFdj93uU4_khPX8T1vLV-Q,Kimberly T.,0,0,7,"San Francisco, CA",,3KdaOh6uJNlp32gzGCXgIw,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=3KdaOh6uJNlp32gzGCXgIw,,,,,
