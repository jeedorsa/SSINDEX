A few months ago, I needed a stop payment on a check, which they refused to do with out a $30 charge. I told them I was going to wait until I moved and changed jobs (as I was in the middle of a cross country move), and close my account, which they refused. Now I just called to cancel and they offered to do the stop payment for free. I refused and wanted to close the account, which they won't do over the phone and a requiring a notarized letter. I told them I would just let the account sit empty then. They said eventually it would go dormant and close. Their customer service has gone so far downhill, it's disgusting.",[],"{'helpful': 0, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 0, 'oh_no': 0}",11/03/2016 17:38:07,1478194687,qVGQ5ozqurnBo5QLwqW4sQ,Amber T.,0,0,1,"Broomfield, CO",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/ntGx72U2RpKq-c_MeuhZ6w/180s.jpg,2FhrR_32O0KQY1lYAy27jg,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=2FhrR_32O0KQY1lYAy27jg,,,,,

Did you know you cannot use the Union Savings Debit Card for any transactions overseas including Canada? It's actually better and cheaper and safer to stop banking there altogether and get a PayPal account which has less fees and is more progressive. They eventually unblocked the card for me for 24 hours. So wait, I can use my own money? That's just unreal. Dear Union Savings Bank Corporate, If you're having problems with fraud overseas you need to build a robust security system, not limit the usage of your customers money. And more importantly, not ask customers to come in a branch and sign a release. That makes no sense. What if The customer was actually in Canada? Customers should be notified via  email that their transaction didn't go through, then be linked to their online account where they can go through a list of security questions and be allowed to charge what they want, wherever they want. Limiting the use of ones money is bad banking. I feel bad for the nice people working at the bank locally in Litchfield that have to enforce these bogus policies. Give them a break too. They don't like having to say ""no"" all the time either.",[],"{'helpful': 0, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 1, 'oh_no': 0}",05/08/2014 15:08:17,1399561697,Te_hCTiTVa7-o6cWg5_4Ew,Paul B.,186,262,179,"New Haven, CT",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/QgKxXYxAmCd-tG9XN4YujQ/180s.jpg,yV9NpQypmc5ME9FgJNQQxg,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=yV9NpQypmc5ME9FgJNQQxg,,,,,

After having lived in a large city and then moving to NWCT I was looking forward to slowing down a bit and enjoying a more relaxed, personal environment. But Union Savings is waaaay too laid back.
Yes, they are nice at the branches, for the most part. I was denied notary services from the branch manager because she ""didn't feel comfortable"" signing the form as she ""hadn't seen one of these particular forms before."" So? It was a legal form. 
My biggest problem was that if I deposited any kind of check on a Friday, it wasn't available until the following Tuesday. If that Monday happened to be a holiday, funds were available the following Wednesday. Today I attempted to log in to my online banking account and I miss-typed my password three times. My account access was blocked and I was prompted to call customer service. Ok, that's cool, you are simply protecting me from fraud. But when I went to call customer service I was told, via a recording, that they do not hold Sunday hours. What would I do if my debit card was stolen? Wait until after the weekend to call?

This is really unacceptable.  I also called the phone number of the head of business banking and got a recording as well.  People at the branch are of course very nice which is great but all the smiles are useless if a bank can't serve the business needs of its customers.
