Unless you are doing deposits or withdrawals, this bank is incapable of handling any other sort of transaction in a timely matter.  Drove to the Boston Post Road location on July 2nd.  There was a sign on the door that said their lobby was closed and that their downtown office was open.  Drove to the downtown office.  Walked to the counter and told the woman that I wanted to close out my son's account.  She told me that a woman at the desk will help you and that you can take a seat.  There was one man in the seat who tried to come in at noon, but was unable to get service because that ONE person who could help him was at lunch.  Poor Bastard!  So he was waiting in one chair which left the other chair open for the both of us.  We waited from 2:00-2:45.  Nobody said, ""thank you for waiting"" or ""sorry we are understaffed.""  One woman was counting money,  another woman was working the counters.  The person working the desk was with a customer, a fourth woman punched out and said goodbye to everyone as customers sat there.  Although no acceptable acknowledgment of their neglect was issued, I did hear the woman counting the money ask why people were waiting, although I couldn't hear the whole response, I did hear ""we can only do, what we can do?""  Meaning, how dare us even attempt to do business on a Friday before the holiday.  This is why we are closing out our account.  My son is going off to college and at the ripe age of 18 he has recognized that this bank lacks any ability to provide customer service.  We walked out at 3:00.

In late December, I needed to close my all of my accounts. These transactions were processed and I was told my accounts were closed. About two months later, I received a notice of a negative balance in an account that should have been closed. After investigating the matter, I found that the account was still open and the bank was requiring payment to close the account. This is terrible customer service. It was through an employee's negligence that my account remained open, and I was charged a monthly service fee. Why should I be held responsible for incompetence?

https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-milford-bank-milford-6?osq=Milford Bank,The Milford Bank,1,"I really hate this bank.  It's almost like they bend over backwards to charge an overdraft fee.  The latest indignity was when I had my ""available balance"" go into the negative after and BECAUSE I made a deposit, apparently because I transferred some of the money into savings.  The teller informed me I was not in danger of an overdraft, but when a $3 check was presented that day, they cashed it and charged me $29.  The next day another small check was cashed, another $29.  The online banking system is about 24 hours behind ""real time"" transactions, so even though I check the stupid thing three times a day and think I have money, I get surprised the next day when it's too late to do anything about it.  It probably doesn't help that my previous bank, in another state, was very customer-oriented;  they did whatever they could to make sure incidents like this didn't happen.  I hate this bank.
