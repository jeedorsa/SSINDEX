Tannith is the assistant manager I believe and the woman in charge of opening accounts. She's wonderful and treated us like family. She's a huge reason as to why I switched banks after my husband did.  It's totally free banking which is awesome because I don't think I should pay an account to keep my money safe when fraudulent charges has happened a few times in the past.

Hats off to you Ion Bank.",[],"{'helpful': 1, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 2, 'oh_no': 0}",10/30/2015 17:02:13,1446224533,FVs26CBeoT1XE1p0LkWgpg,Amanda M.,439,369,260,"Waterbury, CT",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/SBe2XSAi61JO2wjkV4GQjQ/180s.jpg,LIklCQJhth87sBBxmBGxgg,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=LIklCQJhth87sBBxmBGxgg,,,,,

Last year on April 14 I wired $5000 into my wife's HSA account at ION. The wire transfer clearly stated it was a 2014 prior year deposit. Little did I know, until yesterday, ION doesn't ""read wire transfers"" and only deposits them for current year. As a result I can now only add $1750 to her account due to IRS limits. And ION refused to correct the issue and send the IRS an amended docs. Fortunately, I kept proof of the wire memo in BOAs system to show IRS if needed down the road. When I called BOAs HSA dept they were stunned. BOA customer service rep, who has worked for BOA, for 7 years, they said they make HSA corrections all the time and file amended forms to IRS and customer within 3 days. I informed my NML health insurance provider since he recommended the no service bank.",[],"{'helpful': 0, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 0, 'oh_no': 0}",04/12/2016 22:18:37,1460499517,JVafSDyTh3utyAhcNxyg1g,Joe G.,0,0,1,"Westport, CT",,VtDfvdc-s-ecGEXLYfgyUA,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=VtDfvdc-s-ecGEXLYfgyUA,,,,,
