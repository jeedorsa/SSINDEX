https://www.yelp.com/biz/first-county-bank-norwalk?osq=First County Bank,First County Bank,1,"The worst bank I have ever dealt with. I got mortgage from them. First year, they didn`t send me the 1098 form. Second year, even though I`m on auto pay and I pay my mortgage and escrow on time all the time, they failed to pay my real estate tax. I found out after I received a late payment letter from the city with penalty and interest. I left massages to the bank escrow department but nobody called back until I called the original mortgage person Jennifer whom I dealt with at first. She took action and I got an email from the escrow department that they had a system error and they are paying the tax now: after 2.5 months it was due and after the city said that they will put a lien on my property if I don`t pay withing 3 days. The worst bank ever!!! If you want to avoid stress, DO NOT EVER get mortgage from them! I would give negative 10 stars if I could.",[],"{'helpful': 0, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 0, 'oh_no': 0}",03/13/2018 17:45:03,1520963103,7pTL_CDdmBRPPMzQZFOXnA,Sheila S.,0,0,4,"Norwalk, CT",,6KQKhrSFxBfUU-0LfiHfyA,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=6KQKhrSFxBfUU-0LfiHfyA,,,,,
