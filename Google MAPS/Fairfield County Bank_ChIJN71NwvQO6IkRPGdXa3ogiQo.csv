03/30/2023 03:10:19,Nana Cinnabun,"I opened an account here approximately a month ago, every single time I walk into the bank I'm greeted by my name.
Veronica herself greeted me by my full name. I must say, I'm pretty impressed.
It's wonderful knowing the staff at the bank knows your name it makes you feel welcomed, invited and cared for.

Veronica was an absolute joy to work with. She not only helped me open a money market account but also a checking account. She is always smiling and happy, I love that about her.
I appreciate all her efforts.

Showing me the ins and outs of how it all works.
I definitely recommend banking here.

Looking forward to speaking with Walter Romero who does their investments here at this branch.

I had opened an account with Webster Bank, they required a thousand dollar monthly balance in my checking account. So I decided to see what my jobs bank offers which is Fairfield County Bank, they only require a hundred dollars. So it's pretty self explanatory why I closed my Webster account and brought my money here to Fairfield County Bank.

I just want to say.. such a great experience over all.
Thank you to the all the Employees that put their time and attention into each customer that does their banking here.",5

We actually switched our accounts to Fairfield County Bank, because we had received such great service from the Bridgeport branch manager Mrs. Odette Batista at our previous bank. We just had to follow her when to Fairfield County Bank and we couldn't be more pleased with the service we have always received from her. Each and every person, I have had the pleasure to work with at the Bridgeport branch and especially Veronica Foncello has been very courteous, knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. Such service is very hard to find in the banking industry, where most of us feel like a number. It is very comforting to know that your bank knows you by name and takes an active interest to ensure the success of your business.

09/25/2018 17:28:08,BUBSR Mort,"I never complain online but felt it only necessary to do this today.Please keep in mind that I have been with FFD County Bank since the late 90’s and have my paycheck directly deposited to a account with them. I went  to the Bridgeport branch to get some temporary  checks made. I’m out of checks. I only write approximately 20 some odd checks a year from this account and really don’t want to order 100 or so checks.I asked them to print me some checks while parked at the drive up window. I was asked to please come inside. This I did. First County bank will do this whenever I need it at the window, never a problem and totally uneventful at any branch. Not with the Bridgeport Ffc bank. Their business came to a complete stop with my asking for some checks.
There were no customers whatsoever in the bank other than myself.The tone set here was like dealing with a bureaucracy who only wants to tell you NO simply because they can say NO. Not unlike a DMV joke. After three tellers and or managers or whatever they were teaming up against me behind their bulletproof window to equally support their position of telling me NO and that I have to order checks In order to get this otherwise act of goodwill. After my complaing and rejecting their request, they finally gave in and printed up THREE  free checks.This took all of 20 seconds to print the checks. It SEEMED to be a very very difficult task for them. I would suggest they charge me per check, that would be fair. Not here, it became an act of Congress and a very unpleasant experience for something so simple. It’s was very petty and wrong.
Customer service should be happy and nice and accommodating. Please print the checks with the suggestion of ordering more checks. It only took 20 seconds to print the checks, I can’t stress that enough, twenty seconds. And this was only  once someone decided to stop resisting taking care of a customer. It did take them three people to tell me no and fill out the free check ledger that I had to sign.
I am in customer service and have learned that telling my customers no or trying to teach them a lesson simply does not work, it does not get me more customers. It is a must that I go out of my way to accommodate my client in order to keep their business.
I will say that in the past whenever working with the  Norwalk office on new Canaan Avenue, they have always been great and very accommodating and appreciative of my business. Or so it seems to me. Gail Who is in Norwalk is always very understanding and has gone the extra steps several times in the recent past for me when in fact she did not have to.I did not have to beg her or persuade her she simply took care of me. I appreciate her very much and don’t know why the Bridgeport branch would be run any differently.",1
