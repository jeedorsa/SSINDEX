The managers are personable and knowledgeable, the tellers are well-trained. They even recognize our voices on the phone (and know how many lollipops to give the kids which we never have to ask for). It’s the best branch in the area by far. Can’t say enough good things about it. Nice to be with a bank we can trust!",5

I had been dealing with Chase's faulty website for a long time and was very hopeful that Newtown Savings Bank had their act together.  Sure enough, like Pete said they've got a very customizable site and a good app.  They've got 2 thumbs up from me.",5
