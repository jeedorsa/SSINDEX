The issue was resolved quickly and is imagine this is the service everyone is familiar with in banking with this branch. If you’re local, don’t hesitate to check out this bank.

Very unhappy with the service from this branch. Our family is working with this branch to handle finances from our late Uncle. As if dealing with the grief from his passing wasn’t hard enough, we are having to go through extra work to get our inheritance from this bank.

It’s been very difficult to work with them from afar - My family being in Maryland and myself in California. Twice we’ve received bank checks without being signed, at which time we’ve had to send them back for re-issuing.

Would not recommend this bank unless you live local and can proofread every document you receive from them in person— to save yourself the time.

Update: I’ve moved this up to 3 stars as upon seeing this review, the bank quickly course corrected with a sincere apology!! That’s good cuestiones service. I wish the issue didn’t happen in the first place, but I appreciate the way they handled the situation once this was escalated.",4
