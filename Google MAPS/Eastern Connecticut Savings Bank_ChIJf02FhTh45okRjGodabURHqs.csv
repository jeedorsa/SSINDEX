I've been with them for over 4 years, everytime you dispute a transaction no matter if it's $100 or $6 they give you a hard time. Doesn't matter if you say it's fraudulent or not. God forbid you want someone to be blocked from charging your account. (Something ANY bank can do)
They charge you $25 for it, then don't even block the transactions... then won't refund said charge they were blocking. Over the past year this bank has become a nightmare to work with. The hours are weird, they fraud lock your account randomly (except for actual fraud) the ATM's in Norwich and Jewet City are always down for one thing or another.",1

The app works fine & is convenient unfortunately the bank itself has too many hidden fees & charges.
The bank is extremely slow with processing information and they will punish you in extra fees whether it's your fault or not.",3

They won't be a bank in another 5 or 10 years as they are clearly incompetent and incapable of doing business in the 21st century.,1
