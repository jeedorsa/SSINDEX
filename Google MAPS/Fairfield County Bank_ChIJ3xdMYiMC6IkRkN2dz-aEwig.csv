03/30/2022 22:21:19,Paul Kramer,"Fairfield County Bank has been the epitome of what banking service should be for our company and for our family as well. We left a big bank because we were tired of talking to machines and finding a never ending turnover of personnel which made creating relationships virtually impossible. It imbues a sense of trust to bank with  people who know your name and who express appreciation for your business with cheerful service and dedicated problem-solving. We could not be happier banking here and we actually enjoy our trips to the bank. Fairfield County Bank has become a integral part of our business and family. While I am sure the Fairfield County Bank family is of the same culture, I would like to express our appreciation especially for those at the Wilton branch on Danbury  Road.",5

12/16/2020 21:09:54,lisa Bunce,"2020 marked a significant milestone for me.  30 years in private practice!  It also marked 30 years as a Fairfield County Bank, or Ridgefield Bank( as I fondly still refer to it as) customer.   I have always subscribed to the notion of supporting the local merchant, it is an opportunity to support your community as well as build important , lasting relationships that you can count on, and the latter rung true this year.  It goes without saying that 2020 was a tough year for all of us.  For those in business there were many ups and downs, but all along the way the Georgetown Branch management was there to help me stay afloat.  They provided a very personal and compassionate approach when things became tight. Thankfully 2021 is looking much brighter on all levels, but i will never forget how grateful I was and how appreciative I still am, at doing business with FFCB.",5
02/08/2021 22:10:15,Justin Stone,"For many years I've had great experiences at FCB with regard to a variety of different banking needs; indeed, I still choose to rely on many of their services even though I am no longer a Fairfield County resident, as the alternatives I've found elsewhere have been weaker in many respects.  Everyone I've interacted with at FCB has been competent, but I'd like to give a particular hat-tip to Doreen Pastorok, who expediently helped me with several matters recently.",5
