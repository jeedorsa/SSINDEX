HOWEVER, the overdraft forgiveness policy is abismal. My account over-drafted by three times in two days by accident and I was told they can only forgive one of the three and after that they will be no more overdraft forgiveness. On the other hand I know a handful of banks that forgive those if you have a very good reason because these banks understand that sometimes life happens. Canâ€™t say the same about newtown savings bank. I closed my accounts and found a bank that can waive overdrafts and on top of that gives me free ATM anywhere and the fee for overdraft is $29 instead of the $37 I got charged at Newtown. Not that an overdraft will happen again...hopefully. Oh and I almost forgot. The Oxford ATM has a tendency of eating your cash deposits and withdrawals. Happened to me twice!",2
