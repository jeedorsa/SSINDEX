Here are some of the issues I have with Newtown bank:

- Sent me multiple GFEs & Truth in Lending Docs with the wrong terms (I asked for a 20yr loan, and kept getting a 30yr)
- Not accepting anything but a voided check in order to do direct deposit. I even got a letter head from my previous bank stating my routing / account number but wasn't informed that was not good enough till a day before my closing.
- Doubling a coupon book fee. Because of their ""new"" system I was charged twice for a coupon book fee. They didn't tell me though,  I had to ask why my charge was suddenly higher to get it removed.
- Having two different monthly payments displayed between my commitment letter and truth in lending document. Why would they send me information that displayed two different estimates? Clearly no one read the documents before sending them out.
- Mysterious additional charges onto my origination fees. Thought origination fees are not suppose to change? Well not at Newtown Bank if you don't read correctly you may be paying extra for nothing.
- Requiring me to change my deductible on my homeowners insurance to $1000, literally 4 hours before my closing. It's one thing to tell me that your bank has a maximum deductible requirement. It's a completely different issue to inform your customer of that piece of information hours before closing, putting them into a position which is difficult to change without paying hundreds of dollars extra per year.

Bottom line: I won't bank with Newtown ever again on any services they offer and it's not that just I won't recommend that people do business will Newtown, I will go out of my way to inform everyone of my bad banking experience and implore them not to do business with Newtown. (I already convince one person looking to refinance, so your loss Newtown.)",2

The Newtown one 10 minutes more of a drive but the customer service is impeccable. I have had 3 problems with this specific bank same location. May close it and go to chase because of the horrible Monroe location! RUN FROM THIS LOCATION.,1
