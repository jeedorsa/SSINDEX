I had an active checking and savings account for 3 months with weekly direct deposits of $1000+ every Friday.  Then one day the manager calls me and says that they had already closed my accounts and a check would be mailed to my home address.  Before I even had a chance to speak with the manager, Dime Bank had taken upon their decision to do this without my consent or notification prior to this action.  I immediately called them after listening to the manager's voicemail and said that I had a direct deposit coming in the next day and scheduled utility automatic bill payments.
The manager said that there was nothing that they could do since they already closed my accounts.  I requested that they have a check ready for me to pick up later than evening rather than waiting for an unspecified amount of time for it to arrive in the mail.  The manager agreed with my request but my work check was delayed by almost a week since Dime Bank blocked my direct deposit from closing my accounts.
I would never go back to Dime Bank as a customer ever again.  I actually went down the street to get new accounts with a better bank at Charter Oak Credit Union.  Charter Oak has must better customer service, products, and bank related fees.  Charter Oak also has more locations in the areas that I travel through which is definitely more convenient.  They also have a phone app to check your accounts which Dime Bank did not have at the time.",1
