Tina, at the Niantic, went far beyond my expectations in assisting me when my accounts were compromised by a hacker. She had my banking up and running in hours, and the funds returned in one day. You don't get that service in the big box banks. I highly recommend Chelsea Groton Bank.

09/15/2021 21:05:31,Stephen Wilson,I have been with Chelsea since they opened in Niantic and  have never had a bad experience. To best state my  feelings about the people at Chelsea I would say that they are always a JOY. I have known many of the folks that have come through our branch and I can honestly say that they are a very competent and pleasant group.....,5
