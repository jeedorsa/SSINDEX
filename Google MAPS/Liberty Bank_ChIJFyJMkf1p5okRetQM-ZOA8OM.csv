Webster could not care less about my issues despite the money moving through their accounts. Liberty has really proven reliable and responsive. My account reimburses others’ ATM fees and I have had no issues with them since moving to the area. Which on that note: they also have locations in my area while Webster is more SW CT and not much else...

My only “complaint” is the speed of their ATM service at this location. I don’t know if it’s the computer system or the particular machine or what but it’s really slow and needs some calibration because “no...I do not want another transaction.”",4

12/29/2020 02:05:49,Joey Di Buono,I’m not sure how this bank has only 4 stars and not 5 but I’ll help out. I’ve been with liberty since 2005-2011. I moved out of state and when I came back I went right back to them. Everyone I ever met at this branch is super friendly and I’ll never forget the lady that helped me open my first checking account years ago she was super helpful and will always remember that.,5
