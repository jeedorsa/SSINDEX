If I had ten pages to tell the story, I would, but suffice to say that the process wasn't quick or easy, there were a few false starts on homes that didn't pan out, but Gail was always available, either via email or phone, to answer any questions I had. She made what was a very stressful experience the best it could be.",5

And get this, this  so-called ""local bank"" doesn't let you call a local branch, instead that route you to a 1-800 number that no one picks up, a computer tells you to leave a message with a phone number which they never call back. CLUELESS BANK !!!!!!!!",1
