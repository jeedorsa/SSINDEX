02/11/2020 00:03:51,Blue Bleeder CT,Essex Savings Bank is one of the newer banks in town. I have had occasion to do business with them a few times now. Both transactions went smoothly. The tellers are friendly and competent And don't get rattled when there's a Crush of customers. Drive-thru and ATM convenient,5

If you use the debit card then that counts towards your daily usage so you can no longer withdraw funds from the ATM after you use a purchase in a store unacceptable for a business as far as I'm concerned. Can't use the debit card at the gas pump because it flags it for some type of fraud protection it's really just an all-around bad experience we'll be changing back to Bank of America.,1
