This local bank provides outstanding personal attentive service from everyone I've dealt with at this bank specially from Joseph 'Joe' Fernandez who heads the bank in Florida. They are meticulous and they follow through on what they say. So glad I found this gem of a bank. They now have a branch in Coral Gables, FL. A++  - Highly recommended.",5
