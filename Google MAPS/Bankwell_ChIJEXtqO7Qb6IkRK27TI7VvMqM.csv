02/10/2024 19:45:07,Brian Buckmir,What bank is closed on Saturday?! Bankwell that's who. Drove from Weston to Westport to find a locked door with only open branch in Fairfield County in New Canaan. Then had to wait in a busy line there because of the lack of open branches. Very inconvenient bank for me to deposit ten times more than I withdrew making me want to close my account right then.,1
