I moved 6 and a half years ago to another state but kept the account open and active for loyalty reasons. However I came to find out that they changed their policy and was charging me fees for months without knowing. When I called to try to get the fee's back they refused and said they would refund me 34 dollars. It was over 300 dollars of fees they charged me. They then never sent me the check and I followed up multiple times with no answer. I then closed the bank account. They then continue to charge me overdraft fees for an account I closed! I called and now they will only refund me 24 dollars and are officially closing my account. I would never use this bank again and after years of being with them you would think they would treat their customers a little better.",1
