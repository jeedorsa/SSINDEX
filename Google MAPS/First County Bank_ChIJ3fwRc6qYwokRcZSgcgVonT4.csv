I didn't had my deposit slip ready and she started rushing me. She definitely needs to learn how to treat customers. When I was already filling up my slip another car showed up and she started saying that I needed to be ready because I was causing traffic, theres was a single car behind me not a whole line. Very rude.. Other than that all the other people who works there are amazing and super helpful.",3

Anna Marie Socci has been incredibly helpful to me. I had a problem with an unknown fee on one of my accounts and the dispute office and no one else in West Main could figure out what it was from. I was totally frustrated and about to close all my accounts when I finally got to Anna Marie and in 30 seconds she told me where it was coming from! Needless to say, I kept all my accounts and have even opened more after being able to work with Anna Marie! So grateful and happy customer!!",5

05/25/2022 02:15:36,Eric Musto,My fianc√© and I just moved to Stamford and was  looking for a local bank to switch our accounts to and open up a joint account. Upon walking in we were immediately greeted. When asked what they could help us with and after explaining our situation we were introduced to the Branch manager Anne Marie. She walked us through the entire process explaining every step of the way. She was phenomenal! She made the transition a breeze and opening up the joint account was the easiest thing ever. She got our accounts up and running in no time and even helped us set up the app for mobile banking. I have never experienced such hospitality in a bank ever. Recommend this bank to everyone I talk to.,5
06/22/2023 16:28:29,Geraldo Hernandez,I have nade multiple deposits for my employer at this branch and it has been a smooth transaction all of a sudden I go in and they ask for my social and Id and stated that is there policy and it‚Äôs always been that way when I asked to see the policy since I‚Äôve never been asked before the rude lady that was in the back got up screaming stating they do t have to show me the policy that I just have to follow it or they can deposit my employees money I reiterated that I was never asked that before they became rude and decided to no longer answer any of my questions refused to show me the policy and refused to explain why is both my social security number and I‚Äôd is needed and to make it worst the teller that has accepted the deposit in the past without asking for any of that was there and said nothing even when he was addressed this place is unprofessional and the manager is rude and ignorant was more focused on arguing and going back and forth then actually understanding and trying to help do not recommend this bank to anyone that values quality care,1

03/01/2021 21:59:42,Max Grabar,"Tremendous experience. This branch truly has a personal touch and goes above & beyond for anybody (client or non client) that walks in through their doors. I came to this branch because I had a unique situation with my business & the PPP loan and I was seeking guidance, I was able to comfortably explain my situation to Ricky Arriaga over the phone, who then recommended that I get in touch with his manager, Anna Pace. After having a conference with Anna and Ricky, I felt confident that my issue would be taken care of. And I was not wrong, Anna and Ricky worked around the clock to make sure that I had the things I needed to resolve my situation in a timely manner. Mind you, I and my business were not even banking with First County at the time that I walked through their doors seeking help. Within the first five minutes of talking with Ricky and Anna, I wanted to move my business banking to their bank. My situation took less than a week to resolve, and I was not even a customer for the first couple of days, and that says a lot about their personal service and care for the people that walk into their branch. Fast forward to now, I am banking with them and constantly recommending my family and friends to go and open up an account at this branch. A personal touch, especially now a days seems like a lost touch, but this branch  has it and I can't say enough about it. Thank you so much Anna, Ricky, and Jason for your non stop help, and not resting until everything was done from all of us here at Mark S Gross CPA PC.",5
