Bank tellers are not knowledgeable, you must always ask for a manager to yield answers to questions accurately.  Very disorganized with record keeping and documentation that should be on file.",2

Not only is it very easy to get somebody on the phone with Chelsea Groton, it is very easy to use all of their services. Their app is very streamlined, and you don't have to go through 17 different automated systems to speak to somebody. I can't imagine a bank that would serve me better honestly",5
