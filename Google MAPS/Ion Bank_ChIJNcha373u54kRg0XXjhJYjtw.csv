Remarkably inefficient, inexplicably slow, and enough to prevent me from ever opening an account in this bank. Out of all the accounts I've ever had, none of them EVER had to call the person who wrote the check for verification. It's amazing to me that an establishment of Ion' s reputation seems to think that everyday people have a minimum of 20 minutes to waste for them at any given moment. Unacceptable policies.",1
