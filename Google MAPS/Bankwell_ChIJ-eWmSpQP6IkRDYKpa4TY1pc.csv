Unfortunately, due to maddening issues with both mobile and desktops apps (inexplicably unable to log in multiple times and hours long on phone with tech help and multiple password resets just to get in), a total lack of functionality of the ATM (inability to show recent transactions, only your balance), and today, inability to stop payment on a lost check in which I knew the check # and the approximate amount, but not down to the penny, as I forgot to write it down.  So I'm screwed if someone did pick up this check and cashes it.  Disclaimer, I don't know if this would be the case at any other bank, but it was the last straw for me, and I will be closing my account.  I'm sad - if Bankwell can catch up with bigger banks on the technology side, they'd have my business back.  Meantime, this busy and overwhelmed small business owner has no time for such inconvenience.",1

I would not ever recommend a company who does not go above and beyond for customers",1
