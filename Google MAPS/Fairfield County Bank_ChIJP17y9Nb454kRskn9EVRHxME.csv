From taking up their time to discuss hypothetical loan options on a Saturday with two kids in tow, to small issues within our various accounts that they were quick to fix for us, they are always so patient and eager to help. Most recently, they caught (before we did) an issue with fraud in one of our accounts and worked hard to protect us and keep us safe going forward. As a chronic worrier, I feel so safe knowing they're watching out for us.",5
01/13/2023 17:30:48,Paulo Azevedo,"Would like to congratulate the wonderful crew at Fairfield County Bank.
I really feel like I‚Äôm in a private banking experience cause the kind of personal attention I always receive not only in branch but also over the phone.
I specially like the federal road  branch and it‚Äôs bankers. They always makes me feel very comfortable in any type of financial peculiarities.
Special thanks to Cara, Johanna, Ashly  and the whole team at Federal Rd branch, you guys are the best!
Look forward to keep banking with you!",5
02/24/2022 13:50:43,Kimmy Bernal,"The staff here is extremely friendly. I always have an excellent experience dealing with Johanna, the teller in the drive-through. Always has a smile on her face and in a good mood even if I‚Äôm not lol. The teller Trevor is also very pleasant and always smiling which is a refreshing change. I would recommend this bank to anybody with financial needs because they will go above and beyond to help you",5
10/29/2022 15:45:59,Kristi Petersen Schoonover,"I have had an account with them since 1995 (when they were Ridgefield Bank). I am consistently pleased with the friendliness and service, and also, although over all this time I've only had one issue with my bank account, they spent time with me to get it solved. There are also some nice perks--like using the coin machine at no charge if you have an account. Honestly, I could never imagine going to another bank. Also, Johanna is the sweetest person. I look forward to visiting her every time I go.",5

02/24/2022 15:01:32,Krystyna Suska,"As a 30 year a FCB customer I‚Äôm grateful for the opportunity to commend your staff.  In the past I would frequent the Georgetown and Ridgefield branches while living in Redding. November 2019 I moved to Heritage Village in Southbury with the nearest FCB branch 11 miles away at 114 Federal Rd In Danbury CT. I certainly considered changing banks to something local but I decided to stick with you and so far so good.  Part of my loyalty is an outstanding employee like Johanna.  During the Covid pandemic she has raised the drive up teller interaction to an art form.  She is always welcoming, gracious, professional and stylish.  Please recognize her for the asset that she is to your bank.",5
