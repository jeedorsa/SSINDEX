I have to say that each of the employees there have helped me out in more ways than I could have ever imagined.  I've had it rough for a while since I changed jobs. An this bank took care of all my needs, even when I thought there was no help.  They have truly shown me that there are still a lot of wonderful people in this great big world.  So, if you need banking,  don't hesitate to come to JCS bank in Pawcatuck. They are amazing people. Thank you so much Erin. An Shannon.  I don't know what I would do without you guys.",5

They even worked with me as I was going through the zoning and building permits process. I would recommend them highly to anyone who is looking to build a new home.",5
