They were patient, accommodating and quick to help and answer all our questions. We got a great rate and are just super happy with the overall experience. Canâ€™t thank them enough.. highly recommend working with them!",5

They successfully managed to push me to the edge and compelled me to close the house mortgage with more down payment and higher interest rate, is 4 long months when the standard closing timeline promised was 45days. God knows the type of customer service training their employees get cuz my experience was one horror story and the loan officer i had to deal with, barely had any professional ethics. I am never ever working with this bank and will soon refinance and move to another bank for sure.

May be there are other NSB branches with professional employees but this one is a Shitshow.",1
