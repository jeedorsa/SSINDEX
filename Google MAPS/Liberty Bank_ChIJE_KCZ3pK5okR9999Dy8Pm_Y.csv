Iâ€™ve been a customer for almost 20 years and Iâ€™ve reached the final straw and am in the process of closing all accounts with them. For almost everything you have to go to the physical location which is a nuisance. I had a fraudulent charge from a gym (after I canceled my membership they kept charging me). I called Liberty, explained my situation and that I had physical proof of the gymâ€™s error. Liberty rep told me they wouldnâ€™t even investigate. They immediately sided with the business. Since theyâ€™re business is making money off of their customerâ€™s lifeâ€™s earnings, they should have those customerâ€™s backs when their earnings are taken fraudulently, but thatâ€™s not the case with Liberty. I HIGHLY recommend switching to Ally. Customer service is great and Iâ€™m making a ton of money in interest just having a savings with them.",1

It was a weird transaction, yet she made sure to do everything properly, apologising to me for my patience, when honestly, it involved found money, so I would have happily waited! Thanks again to everyone at Liberty Bank, but especially Kate!!",5
05/27/2022 22:24:56,Mike VA,"Liberty Bank is the best bank around if you live in CT. This branch has a lot of nice staff, though the manager is a bit of a stickler. She made me drive home to print a copy of a document I needed notarized instead of just using their printer. Minor annoyance but still an annoyance.",4

She was very knowledgeable and professional about what I was looking for in what the bank had to offer, which was the best for me. The drie-up tellers are also very good at the window and always helpful and more than happy to answer any questions you may have ðŸ˜ƒ",5
08/24/2020 17:51:29,Deb Johnson,Not good at all! Drive up window  ... 2 windows open arrived at 1:16 still sitting in line of 3 vehicles at 1:47 presently.  Newly relocated to area wanting to make this location my new bank... seriously doubting that choice.... 1:48 first vehicle just departed..... I am accompanying an account holder... who is also not pleased! Thinking itâ€™s time for a new banking decision on my part.... ðŸ‘Ž,1
08/03/2019 14:58:12,Nicole Schiavone,Crystal is so rude. On multiple occasions. No customer service skills at all. I asked a simple question & she snapped back with a horrible attitude. I asked why I had to come down to the bank so my husband can cash a check made out to both of us when I did mobile banking & cashed multiple checks from our wedding May with no issue. Pretty much called me a liar. Thank god I never usually have to go into the bank since one the few occasions I have been in their she has had a attitude. Get over yourself.,1
