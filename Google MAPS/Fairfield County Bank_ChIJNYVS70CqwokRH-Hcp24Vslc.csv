02/01/2024 00:11:02,Christine Farrington,We're new to the neighborhood and we're looking for a bank.  The interest rates are competitive and the service provided by AVP Assistant Branch Manager Diana Kessler was friendly and efficient.,5
01/29/2024 15:19:46,Megan Couri,Diana Kessler is a wonderful and friendly manager. She helped me set up a business account quick and easy with no hiccups.,5
07/11/2023 17:53:44,Brayton Sparks,Do not apply for loans here. They sell your information and nobody even called me about my application. Also I had no help filling it out. Other banks have helped me fill everything out much to provide a better experience.  I’ve gotten so many calls for telemarketing after applying here. Go to BOA much better experience. I don’t get why people like small banks. Never have had a good experience. From when I bought my home 3 years ago …. This bank was disappointing and to my most recent experience.,1

05/16/2023 20:00:06,Tracey Katrina Leon,Alexis Burch was wonderful and made it so easy to pen a new savings and checking account.  Her knowledge and communication skills are exceptional.  I’d give her 10 ⭐️ if I could.  So glad I am a new customer,5
08/11/2022 20:33:51,Judith Factor,Friends of Karen is grateful for the support of Fairfield County Bank and their community of employees and customers.  They partnered with us to collect school supplies and back packs to donate to the local families caring for a child with a life-threatening illness such as cancer.  We received 100 gorgeous back packs and a marvelous array of school supplies that will be given to children whose lives have been turned upside down due to serious illness.  The Fairfield County Bank is an integral partner in promoting the well-being of those living in their locations throughout Fairfield County.  We are proud to be a beneficiary of their good works and truly value a business that takes such in active role in the community in which its customers and employees live and work.,5

05/10/2022 19:21:17,Christopher Curran,"Our 501(c)(3) charity, Kindness Over Muscular Dystrophy, has been banking with Fairfield County Bank for a little over two years now and we could not be more pleased with the level of service and professionalism. Kathy Graham, the Ridgefield CT bank manager, has been responsive to our questions and helped us on numerous occasions quickly get the answers we needed to proceed with our charitable programs. Customer Service Representative, Alexis Burch, has also helped us on several occasions and we found her to be very thorough in tracking down a charge that we had trouble identifying. In fact, the entire staff at the bank is friendly, welcoming, and always willing to go the extra mile to resolve any issue we might have.
Community banks are the backbone of this country and Fairfield County Bank helps so many local Ridgefield merchants do business -  that benefits all of us in Ridgefield! We are proud to support this excellent bank.

When checking my Fairfield County Bank App.that night, I became aware of the problem. The next morning I went to the bank on Danbury Road to try and fix the situation.  The Assistant Branch Manager, Diana Kessler, met with me in her office and was able to completely fix everything that had happened. She knew exactly what to do. I went home feeling so much better than when I arrived! Thanks, Diana. I highly recommend Ridgefield Bank!",5

12/11/2021 15:05:04,S Horosky,"To start, I will tell you that I have been a Fairfield County Bank customer for a very long time. Due to Covid, I had not stepped foot inside the bank in close to two years. After figuring out that I had to push the doorbell in order to be admitted to the bank, a young gentleman named Angel started to help me. From the moment I started working with Angel, he went above and beyond to make sure that I got all of the documents that I needed. Even after leaving the bank, he continued to follow through and call me to ensure that everything was taken care of. My documents were wrapped perfectly and sorted by year. Thank you to Fairfield County Bank and to Angel!",5

05/06/2020 20:15:14,L.P. Fletcher,Shout out to the Danbury Rd office of Fairfield County Bank for working diligently in getting my PPP Loan through the process with SBA successfully!  I heard that employees literally worked around the clock to get these loans entered on the SBA's system with a shift from midnight to 9am.  Thanks for your hard work in looking out for the little guy! This is one of the many reasons I've chosen to work with a smaller home town bank.,5

01/20/2018 10:35:33,Angelo Cenotti,I had a very rude experience at this Bank I had a check drawn from this bank I showed 2 forms of ID my driver's license and military ID the teller threw back my military ID and said it was not a valid ID and her kids have the same type which I find it hard to believe I am a disabled veteran served my country honorably they refused to honor the check stating that I have to have an account with them and regularly use that bank I never had any problem with any other bank's but this one disrespects veterans and treats non account holders like second rate citizens I highly recommend that no one uses this bank and their tellers should get some customer relation training because they are down right offense especially to veterans,1
