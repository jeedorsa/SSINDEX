12/08/2021 18:34:04,Jackson Wheeler,READ THIS!!! HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! I wouldn’t give this bank one star. They hit me with $100 of overdraft fees from $90 worth of payments!!! Even with Covid and being sick all of last month there was no way they could overturn the overdraft fees for me. I told them I’m very busy and don’t have time to waste on things like this. They simply kept offering other services to me but I just want my money back!!! On top of this their ATM’s are as old as dirt and probably run off coal!!! I just ordered a card from Varo which doesn’t make you pay overdraft fees and I’m about to close my account here. I was planning on applying for a loan and opening a savings account with them today but they couldn’t help me with this one thing. That goes to show you their level of customer service! I would suggest to try anything else before opening an account here!,1

one of the customer service person got too personal and asked me how much money I had total, how much I was getting, and I ""needed"" to put all of it in. Because of this set of events, looked at other options at different banks",2
