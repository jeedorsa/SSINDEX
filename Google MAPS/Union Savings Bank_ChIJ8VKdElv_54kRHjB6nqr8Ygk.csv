Deb the manager is always there to help and Elisa so friendly.

The bank itself is not like the other banks and they dont rail you with fees and finance charges. They treat you like a person not like a number.

Get out of the big corporate banks and switch to this one.",5

I absolutely love this Bank, they have always been very helpful when you had any question or a problem, they were always there for you and more willing to help you in any way that they can. But I really love is the fact that their name stay the same after all these years. I highly recommend them to anyone is interesting in finding a home-based bank.",5
10/21/2019 13:12:23,Rodney Bourdeau,On a visit to the North St Branch a week or so ago I was received as usual by a friendly teller names Louis.  He not only handled my transactions professionally  but also looked the part by his appearance  His neat shirt and tie spoke the part as well.  I would look forward to Unions Savings Bank returning to the dress code requiring a shirt and tie by gentlemen representing this professional institution. Rodney L. Bourdeau,5
