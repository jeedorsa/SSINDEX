I was very disappointed to see that they do not have the personalized service they once had, which led me to get a couple fees for a transaction that took place in my account. In the past, I would have gotten a call to alert me to a problem that was arising and it would never have gone this far. When I reached out and spoke to the assistant VP, he was very friendly and responsive, but he was not able to fully rectify the situation of reversing both fees when he spoke with a higher up a the bank (he did reverse one fee). It seems like it didn't make any difference that my husband and I have been loyal customers for so many years. It was a real disappointment that the bank did not honor this long standing relationship and take into account the changes that have taken place since the bank has grown in size (i.e., no more  reaching out to let a customer know a problem is arising, which I wasn't aware of until this problem arose).",3

It seems that while other banks started to relax their rules and allow customers to enter their branches as society began to adjust to COVID—19, SBD - as recently as July (the month of my most recent visit) - maintained a minimal at best access protocol.  The problem, at least from my experience, is that this was not reflected on the main entrance of the branch.  Other banks, such as Webster, displayed signs indicating, “By appointment only.”  People’s United Bank - with social distancing protocols in place - was allowing walk-ins in July.

And now for the “new” New Milford branch (“the ‘new’ NM branch or “the branch”).

I sometimes feel, having watched and listened over the years, that I know more than the person sitting across the desk or standing on the other side of the counter.

I went into the new NM branch on July 13, 2020 to make a deposit to two different accounts.  (Just to note, while I take COVID-19 seriously, I have not encountered any other banks and / or businesses where “once you touch a pen it’s yours.  I walked out with at least two SBD pens that day.)

I was taken inside “as a courtesy” by a gentleman who, I believe, said his name was Jay.  (Note:  Initially, it seemed as though my business was destined to be conducted in the parking lot but I DIDST protest because it was, quite simply, much too hot outside.). Once inside, I dealt with Jay and a young man by the name of Mustafa.  I am not overbearing or a micromanager by any means, but I conveyed from the get go what I was looking to do and watched as my transactions were processed.

To make along story short, this is what transpired upon my exiting the branch but prior to driving off:

I found an error, called the branch, and was told that Jay would come to me.  (We were going to conduct at least some business in that parking lot come **** or high water!).  Upon coming out, Jay said the mistake had already been fixed in the computer but had me “sign the updated sheet anyway.“. And, once again, I got to keep the pen.

At home, I found what I thought to be another error and decided to notify the branch via email.  I called the SBD main number and was told that the branch email was newmilforddanburyrd@sbdanbury.com.  I then sent an email, addressed to Jay and Mustafa, clearly outlining the error.  To this day, I have never heard back from either of them.

I received two pieces of correspondence from SBD revealing that my requests were not correctly fulfilled back in July.

Personally, I am starting to lose faith in SBD (especially since there are so many other banks to choose from with a wider array of account types to choose from).  And I would be more understanding if they were busy that day, but I was the only patron in the branch.
