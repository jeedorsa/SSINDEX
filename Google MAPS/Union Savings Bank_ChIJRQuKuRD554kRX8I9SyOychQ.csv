01/15/2014 23:07:41,Jaime Smith,"Hands down worst banking experience of my entire life. I have been waiting for almost a month for a new debit card to be issued, receive no calls back and have officially given up, intend to close out my account at the very next chance I am near the local branch. I have considered changing banks in the past when things were issues and the bank wouldn't call back for issues, everyone I know in Brookfield has closed out their accounts and moved to other banks, I endured far too many head aches before I did the same. I would NEVER recommend this bank to someone else.",1

If I ever have a problem, which is seldom, I am confident it is resolved in a timely fashion and the reason is explained to me.",5
