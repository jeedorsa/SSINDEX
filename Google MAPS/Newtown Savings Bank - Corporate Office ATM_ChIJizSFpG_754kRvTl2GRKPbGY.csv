05/29/2020 23:36:43,Korrie-Lia Domain,Unfortunately I am very disappointed in the mortgage services Newtown savings Bank. As a banking customer here I figured I would call the mortgage department first for my first home purchase. I originally talk to Trisha who then passed me off to Vic and both gave me the runaround and told me to call back when I had a perfect scenario. Unfortunately perfect is not the world we live in however I have everything needed for my first home purchase . Neither gave me advice or took more than five minutes of there time on the phone and once they both realized it wouldnâ€™t be a quick push of the button they stopped answering and taking my phone calls. Very disappointed in a local bank I would not refer them to anyone,1

No other bank (including local banks) take 2-3 days and hours of work just to set up external bank to bank transfer, as well as no other bank offers mobile deposits but require you to get approval to do mobile deposits. These issues is what banks were doing in the beginning, now with all the stream line digital products there should be no reason for such delays.",3
