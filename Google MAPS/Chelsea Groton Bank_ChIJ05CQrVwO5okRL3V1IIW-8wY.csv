It was easy to open it online, I just wish one of the few employees had offered it to me instead of sitting and wasting my time. Idk if they just don't know that is an option, or didn't think they needed to tell me about it .. other than that, nice bank, the ATM is awesome lots of features, even face to face with teller through ATM.",3

During this period my RI license has expired. So CBG in new london REFUSES to cash my check now. The branch manager Carleen Lee says they are not ALLOWED to cash them. This is a total lie. They have cashed my check since. So either she is a liar, or the tellers are wrong. Mrs Lee's business card says assistant secretary, so I'm gonna go out on a limb and say she is full of sh1t. I've had nothing but nightmares with this bank.",1

They told me they would call me for financial help and tips, that day or two days later (because I was busy the day after)  and almost a month later they haven't called me",3
