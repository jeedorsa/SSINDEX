04/04/2023 20:20:42,Keara Berisso,"If I could give more than 5 stars, I most definitely would. At the law firm where I'm a legal assistant, I work closely with this branch of First County Bank. If I need copies of bank statements for clients or if I call about a random account inquiry, they are always willing to help me, even if it means taking extra time to assist. I appreciate everyone who helps me from this branch and it always brightens my day just to speak with them, have it be through email or phone call. If you are looking for a company to bank with and even specifically, a branch to visit when you need assistance, First County Bank in Westport is the place to be!",5
