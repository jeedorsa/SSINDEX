12/24/2023 04:31:22,Nicole O,"I reviewed Liberty previously but my review vanished mysteriously. Liberty as a business is unethical. I had a checking/savings with them for nearly two decades. After fulfilling my contractual obligation with the local Planet Fitness and cancelling, my cancellation wasn’t processed correctly and the gym continued to bill me for 3 months fraudulently. I cancelled PF in person and because they were swamped at the time, (hence the incorrect processing) they didn’t give me documentation. I called Liberty, explained the situation, and asked the charges to be refunded. The rep immediately sided with the business and told me they couldn’t help me and that they wouldn’t even investigate. So Liberty Bank is in business by making money off of your life’s earnings, but they don’t have your back to protect those earnings when companies steal them fraudulently. Something to consider. Integrity is important. Brick and mortar banks are dated anyway. I cut ties with these guys and I’m making a killing in interest at Ally.",1

There where a trail of mistakes from the beginning like; Fatmir/Liberty bank mailing my visa secured credit card to incorrect address, Lisa Meriden Liberty branch manager co-insuring with him, clearly seeing his mistakes, Gary M. Corporate Security, alleging me of Liberty ongoing mistakes, and also, not investigating cameras from ATMS  that my money was stolen from. My worse banking experience ever, mind u I have a checking account for 5 years with another bank,& never endured what I did with Liberty.

Sincerely,
