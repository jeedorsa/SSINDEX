I have never went to a branch and been treated as bad as I was treated by Sandra Vaz. She claimed to be citing policy. However, failed to produce the policy in writing. When she was requested to call corporate my transaction was allowed to process as requested prior to her false policy. She was extremely condescending, treating me as if I was fabricating what could have easily been proven. This interaction has me rethinking my banking relationship. Going back to Webster.",1
