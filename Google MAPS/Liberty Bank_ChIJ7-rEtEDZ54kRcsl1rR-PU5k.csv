They never answer the 888 telephone # and the tellers have very little banking knowledge except for routine transactions.  The manager was supposed to get back to me when the teller couldn't help me, but she didn't call.  It is so frustrating to
deal with such an unresponsive bank.  I'm out of there asap.  At this moment I've been on hold for 20 minutes.  %^%$#@@$^%&()(**^%#$%^!!!!!!!",1
