Then I was told I had to go inside, after waiting, nothing over $1000. At the drive-through. Need to go inside.üé§üéßüòé",2
11/10/2022 00:59:55,Victoria Almonte,My husband Max Almonte stops by weekly. He loves the customer service! He is treated with respect always. We must say April is a tremendous asset to the bank family.,5
10/22/2021 00:04:26,Meghan Mallett,"Professional tellers who are prompt, kind and efficient. Recently needed some assistance with an issue, they (April) took the time to do some research and had paperwork ready for me within an hour. We‚Äôve used them for years and have always had a great experience!",5
05/27/2022 14:57:46,Julie Kikla,"I worked with this bank for almost four years. They did not support from the minute we closed the small business loan. Further, though payments were being made, they still demanded the loan due while our business was fully impacted from Covid. They also sent miscalculated payments (clearly in their favor), and when it came to SBA assistance programs, we had to follow up with them to share the latest. There are many banks out there who will treat you like a human and work with you when you face difficulty (like a global pandemic). This is not one of them. If looking for a personal or business loan, save yourself the pain and frustration of working with this robotic team and find somewhere else.",1
04/24/2020 13:58:23,dolandlydia,"This bank has been very efficient and personal. I had bought a house in 2009, was financed by liberty mutual, they ended up selling my mortgage several times to huge faceless institutions.. When I finally remortgage with them cut my interest my 2 percents, have went to bat for me with my former bank and insurance company. Also a year later I had a personal tragedy and needed to get my hands on 25000, they gave it to me. I have confidence and security with bank. I recommend them highly. They are truly a small town bank. Just what I was looking for. Not a faceless banking institution.",5
01/17/2018 17:01:53,Jeff McCarthy,"This place is seres the rich not the mundane. The jokes they tell about the locals while waiting in line are offensive. The place is never busy, but it always takes 20 minutes to get serviced. The coin machine is down, they do not like to count change and they‚Äôll let you know it. Unprofessional and overall inadequate. If you can go to another bank do so. Unless you‚Äôre wealthy and White, the. You‚Äôll fit right in.",1

I have recommended this bank to many friends.",5
07/16/2015 01:56:24,Joseph Boland,"Hours are awful and online banking here is a joke. There is no mobile application and the existing online banking is difficult to navigate.

The people are nice and they have a few locations though, but it doesn't help if its never open

UPDATED July 15, 2015:

Jewett City savings bank updated their online banking and added a banking app and now allows more accounts to be available online. So I am much happier now that I can easily access my accounts from my phone",5
01/11/2021 17:21:04,Veronica Avery,"I have been a customer of this bank for many years. I am surprised to see the negative comments here. Having worked with the public for many years myself, I would like to suggest something to those who are not satisfied.  When you approach someone, do so with a smile on your face.  Say ""hello, how are you today?"" before you tell them what you need them to do for you.  They are there to help you.  Just try it and see what happens.  No one wants to be greeted  with a demanding approach.  Do you?  Take this suggestion in the manner it is intended. This is also a good thing to do when calling on the phone.  I find that many times it is a
surprised reaction when I greet them in this way before I explain what I need from them.  I am not  downing  anyone. We all have bad days and personal struggles.  So does the staff.  If you have a problem, remember that they did not create it but will help you solve it or suggest what can be done.  In these hard times it is especially important that we remember that we are all in this together.
Thanks for taking time to read this.  I am an extremely satisfied customer.",5

11/23/2015 15:32:20,Tito Pacheco,This Small Time Bank Charges You For All Type Banking Needs. From Money Withdrawals While Using Your ATM To Cashing In Penny's. Yes You Need An Account But In The Several Times I've Been There The Lady At The Desk Has Misinformed Me To Making Me Look Like An Idiot For Trying To Cash In  $2.50 Worth Of Penney's. I Don't Recommend Anyone From Out Of Town Doing Any Banking At This Place. The Only Thing They're Good At Is Being Unprofessional !,1

06/29/2016 19:23:59,Brian Stepnowski,The tellers are all awesome! Like this bank but the hrs kinda stink. I get out of work around 4 during the wee and never can make it in time. At least 5pm m-w would be nice.,4
03/20/2020 18:44:06,S G,The entire staff that works at this bank on Main St in Jewett City is very stuck up & rude. My fiance just went in there & was treated like a piece of dirt. They should be ashamed of themselves!!,1

08/29/2018 01:52:33,Luis Oviedo Ortiz,"Es un poco arcaico el Banco. No tengo quejas, pero desde que contrate la cuenta nunca pude usar el homebanking; si o si tengo que contactarme por tel√©fono para poder ingresar o habilitar la cuenta. Solo me paso en este lugar. Sacando que es un banco poco amigable a la tecnolog√≠a, lo dem√°s es excelente.",4
