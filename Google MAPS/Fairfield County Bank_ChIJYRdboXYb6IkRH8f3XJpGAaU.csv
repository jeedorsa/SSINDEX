11/13/2023 23:25:08,Georgette Kapetaneas,"Virginia Turnbull at Fairfield County Bank, for not the first time, came through on a commercial loan in a ridiculous time constraint.  Something that easily could’ve taken months at other banks, was completed in a matter of weeks, with the least amount of hassle possible.  Her professionalism, experience, and quick correspondence were key factors in simplifying what easily could’ve been a complicated situation in other hands. Thank you FCB!",5
04/04/2023 16:10:31,Worldwide Diagnostics Information,Had an issue with a forged check issue at two banks.  Yamina at Fairfield County Bank handled in person.  She put me at ease and it was resolved in a day.  The other bank told me to call a number and work and handle it on my own.   Fairfield County Bank again proved the benefits of using a local bank.,5
