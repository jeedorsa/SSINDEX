They received an ELECTRONIC transfer of funds for $9,000 verified by phone with the sending bank, but did not post the transaction that day, as it was 2:01 pm, so I must wait for the money on Monday. Going to close this account as they don't have real time banking.  Their motto should be ""never fathered for you"" as this is what they have done time and time again. Community banking suck so bad with them. So I am moving my banking business to Sikorsky Financial Credit Union. Just down the street. Never there for the disabled. Choose wisely.",1
