Everyone that works there goes above and beyond from the tellers to the branch managers all the way up to the President Frank Gaudio. I love banking at a small community bank. I have banked at other community banks in the past, however FBG stands head and shoulders above them. As a matter of fact, I have a bookkeeping business and to date I have referred at least 1/2 dozens clients to them with out any reservations.  I always know they will make me look good.",5
