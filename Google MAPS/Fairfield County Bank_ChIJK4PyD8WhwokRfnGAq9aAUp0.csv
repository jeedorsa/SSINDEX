09/08/2023 10:26:43,Nancy Romberg,"I recently visited the Stamford Office.  What a delight to work with Theresa. Not only did my needs get met with ease, promptly and professionally, I heard about new things coming to the branch and felt like a valued client.  Even though online access is efficient, there is nothing like personal, face to face interaction. Ron came into the office to greet me as well.   Friendly, knowledgeableâ€¦. Itâ€™s like family.  This bank is big bank services with community bank warmth and welcome.  Nothing betterâ€¦. Thank you!",5

I once lost my wallet in a foreign country and they worked with friends / family back home to get me a new debit card so I could return home! My other banks were not willing to help in this way.

12/03/2020 00:48:01,Pebbles F.,"Fairfield County Bank came recommended by a family member. I'm thinking of changing the one I currently bank with and decided to see what Fairfield had to offer. From the moment I walked in, Janet greeted me with such a smile ! I discussed with her the accounts I currently hold & what my intentions were.

I look forward to a long relationship with this branch. Thanks to Janet, Ronald  and the team !",5
06/21/2022 14:04:06,TomQnel,"Update: June 2022:
While we all had to deal with the virus, Fairfield County Bank did maintain banking options available to us. The lobby is available for in person visits. I have to say their branch manager, Janet West, is a pleasure to work with. She is in a perpetual state of joy and is efficient and will do what is required to retain clients banking needs.

While not the biggest on the banking block, this locally based bank offers some personalized service that can't be matched by the huge institutions that are managed by people you never see and underwriters that have no idea of what you do or who you are. If you are seeking a local banking partner to be there when you need them, check out Fairfield County Bank!",5

03/08/2019 23:32:12,Damien,You should change your Friday hours to 4.55 because that when he locked the doors today. Not only did I not get my busness withdrawal to cover a sales tax bill the manger had the balls to tell me he closed at 5pm and call me a lier. Why open a branch in Stamford if you don't work the hours publushed on your website. Then when i call the home office and got them to call him he then said the voult timer shut down at 5pm and now he can't hlep me. Jesus management make a change here or he'll close the place for you.,1
