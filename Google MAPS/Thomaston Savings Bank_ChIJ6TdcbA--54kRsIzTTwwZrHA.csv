03/16/2022 21:32:01,Tak Cabbage,Everyone was so helpful opening my accounts . It was seamless. Love the main branch in Thomaston. Keep them happy. You have a well oiled machine. Give them a Friday lunch delivered to them . Wonderful crowd and they deserve it. Will never have to change banks due to your employees that work there.,5
08/20/2021 14:31:47,Andre Stavis,Horrible experience as well I agree with the customer that spoke up about poor customer service. I contact my loan officer for a mortgage. He doesn’t answer the phone so then I text and email. I’ll ask a three to four part question because I’m a first time home buyer and have questions. He’ll respond exactly a week later with the shortest amount of words possible and misspell half his words which does t make any sense. Then he’ll respond to one out of my four questions. Which frustrates me. I also agree with the loss of paperwork. The paperwork I sent he claim to never received them. Till I contact the manager and she finds them in one minute. Now I’m advised to email both parties. But this happens more times than one or two and the manager is constantly making excuses for him! This will be the last time I deal with this bank and I will tell all my friends and family to stay away. In addition I email these two individuals about the conditions of my paperwork so I can make closing deadline and three emails in no response. I agree 100 and 10 percent with the review on poor customer service and when the bank responds how can they make this better…. Get new employees who care about there job. I’m sick and tired of corporate America protecting there own and making excuses anyone can clearly see these individuals don’t care. If I’m challenged on this I will post all my emails and responses and every potential customer will see. If I lose this deal due to the bank I’m going to seek funds of the money I invested. For the record my name is Andre Stavis,1

12/27/2019 00:06:46,Nichole L,"Never go here for a mortgage. Both my husband and I, and another set of family members had horrible experience. There was no communication, they never return calls. They did not understand that renters need a general time line in order to give notice to move out. They don’t even push to meet a mortgage contract deadline (the sellers had to keep signing a mortgage extension which they weren’t happy about). There was even times that paperwork wasn’t correctly filled out for buyers to sign. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere when trying to buy a home.",1
