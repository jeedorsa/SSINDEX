06/20/2023 19:48:39,Michele Daunis,A bank that doesn't cash their own checks. The bank manager Carol Johnson is EXTREMELY rude and unprofessional.  I will never use this bank for my personal accounts.  Can you imagine an estate check drawn from fair field county bank that they refuse to cash? I can't.  Very poor customer service.,1
