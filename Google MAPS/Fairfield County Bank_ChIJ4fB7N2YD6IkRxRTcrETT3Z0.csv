08/12/2020 19:53:57,Eric K,Fairfield County Bank has the most outstanding staff. They are always willing to go above and beyond to ensure I feel comfortable while solving any banking problems I may have. I set up a business account at the Weston branch with Dan and he truly made it an easy and great experience. All the staff consistently deliver exceptional results. I have no plans on leaving this bank any time soon!,5

Both of my kids have savings accounts here and now they are 'graduating' to checking accounts before they head off to college. FCB offers free checking for young people. Since my son just got his first 'real' job, that comes in especially handy. Also, my favorite teller, Libby Cailen, put me in touch with one of FCB's insurance specialists to help me review my current insurance portfolio to get great coverage for less money. Everyone there is always friendly when we come in, especially Libby.",5
