I really enjoyed our conversation,  as it didn't feel stuffy like most other banks.  She gave me a lot of knowledge of the bank.  I grew up here in Danbury, Connecticut and never realized that Savings Bank of Danbury has been open for a 170 years....wow!  Also having attended Danbury High School, I had the opportunity to meet Mr. Hal Wibling's daughters.   He is the Chairman of this establishment, and the family integrity is well represented by they banking institution.",5
