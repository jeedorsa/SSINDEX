I highly, highly recommend her.  I couldnâ€™t have asked for a better experience with NSB.  It far exceeded not only my expectations but what i thought was a possibility.",5
07/10/2021 16:09:31,Payam Moein,the agent I was assigned to for my mortgage was the most unprofessional and disrespectful bank agents I have ever seen. the first few encounters he seemed friendly. but he became very rude on the phone when I called him regarding a house we wanted to purchase on a holiday. this was part of his job to respond to clients on that holiday but he acted as if I was abusing him. in the last call that day he literally started yelling like a maniac and said I was using him and that I was wasting his time. in the end he said he would send me the letter but he didn't want to hear from me again and hung up. I was in shock how a bank agent treats customers like that. later I heard he is well known to be cranky but that definitely does not make the bank look good. I switched to a different bank the same day and found a very professional agent who helped me and we actually got a mortgage with a lower interest rate. make sure you shop around and think twice before choosing this bank for mortgage.,1

I received an immediate phone call from one of the managers when suspicious activity was detected on one of my accounts. I have contacted the bank regarding issues with the website which was dealt with quickly and efficiently.  I have nothing but positive things to say about this bank.",5
