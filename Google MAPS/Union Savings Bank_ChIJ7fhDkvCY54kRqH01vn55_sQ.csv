The Torringford st branch is exemplary with their service as well as the canton one, however this branch on main st in Torrington has never given me or my mother great service. They are slow, they make you feel as if you are a burden to them, and they are not very customer friendly. I waited in the drive through for 5-8 minutes to be addressed, then another 10 to get my receipt back for depositing a check overall it was 15-20 minute wait. Another time I went the woman just said hello grabbed my deposit slip then went and helped another customer in the middle of my transaction. My mother has also stated that his main st branch is always rude to her as well. Maybe the management there is bringing down their employees or maybe they all just really dont want to be there, but they could learn a thing or two from the wonderful folks at the Torringford branch. The other branches i go to are efficient, engaging, and courteous, you can tell they care about their clients.",2

I will say that I love the centrality of the place but the entrances and exits are like driving up then next driving off of a curbside not to mention the absurdly narrow entryway from main Street,4
