She will do whatever it takes to do what's best for us and our business. We truly appreciate all her help and knowledge. This branch also has a great team all the way around. Keep up the great work!,5

Since then they have ALWAYS been in good standing with our family. I currently use the Devon branch for my business account and Kristine is awesome to work with. My partner and I couldn't be happier and more trusting of her. She's always looking out for what is best for us and our business, and that goes a long way. Kristine is very approachable and knowledgeable on all matters at the bank. The rest of the staff in the branch is also attentive and easy to work with as well. Thanks for all you do for us",5
