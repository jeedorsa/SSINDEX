Edit:
Had to remove a star based on my last experience. Branch was not open at stated hours so I had to use the ATM, and the receipt printer was printing out info on other people’s transactions.. not very secure. Tried to tell the staff inside but they wouldn’t open the door or drive up window to speak to me.",4
04/15/2016 16:23:55,patsy santangel,I have been a banking with bankwell for 3 yrs now .I have a mortgage with them and  checking and savings account there .I was interested in doing more business with the bank but Bob Palermo did such a horrible job of never returning my call or even listening to any proposals. This information is documented by a member of the board of directors.So I will take business elsewhere ..,2

Very unprofessional, wouldn't return calls. Also, left messages with Michael's boss and still no return phone calls!!",1
