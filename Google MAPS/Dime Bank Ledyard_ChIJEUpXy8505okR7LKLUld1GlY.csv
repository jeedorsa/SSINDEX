If it's possible for me drive to New London or Norwich to do most of my banking, I will. The employees in all the other branches are pleasant and respectful.",1

Collette Ladd (one of the managers) is great and the staff has always handled my phone calls and any problems with kindness and professionalism! Highest rating from me!",5
