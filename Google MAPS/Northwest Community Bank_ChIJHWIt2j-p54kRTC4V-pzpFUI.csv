Not only going through obstacles to cash MY BUSINESS CHECKS but the employees are all clueless, young and must be under paid that they counted my money over 5 times!! They dont use money machines to count. Just very weird environment. What a waste of time. Never have i been through a situation as the past few times here. Stay away.",1

Another tried to be helpful , but kept me waiting in the parking lot for 45 minutes without telling me what was going on when they told me  it would be about 15 minutes. I finally had to call them to only find out they want me to come back tomorrow because of my change of address. Why did they not tell me this ? They made me late fir my next appointment. No one apologized. Definitely would not open an account at this bank ever. Very unprofessional in the Avon office",1
