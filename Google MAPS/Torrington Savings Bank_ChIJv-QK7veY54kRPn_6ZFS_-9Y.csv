As an institution that manages its customers money, holds its customers money, AND MAKES PROFIT OFF OF SAID CUSTOMERS MONEY etc - there is absolutely no justification for them not being open 7 days a week OR AT MINIMUM having at least a fully capable call center 24/7 to handle absolutely all issues that crop up. I understand it's a small town bank, but it's also 2023 and technology has advanced sufficiently enough for them to be able to help us 24/7.",4

ITS CRIMINAL. And this is the reason I went to this bank in the first place. This is Ashley McCarthy, Melissa, and the bank manager Kathleen Biggs who evidently has no clue what is going on in her own bank. It is being reported. What is going on with everyone else who has submitted their financial info to this bank who has it? Where is it going? Everybody keep an eye on all your accounts.",1
