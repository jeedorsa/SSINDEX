03/09/2022 15:51:02,Mark Primiano,I have been using this bank for the last 8 to 10 years.  Always very friendly people working at the branches (Ridgefield and here local in New Fairfield)  Carla & Alfredo were extremely helpful with me this week to set up my business checking account.  It is great to know there are local people just like us who are here to help with questions & resolutions when needed.,5
