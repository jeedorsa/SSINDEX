All of the tellers in the Putnam branch are always so kind, helpful, and detail oriented. The branch manager, Amanda, has personally helped me so many times with my non-profit business account! Everyone in the branch says makes it a priority to say “hello” and ask how your day is when you walk in, they will remember your name, and they ensure that you are fully satisfied and served before you leave! I would recommend JCSB to anyone looking for a local bank to do business with!",5

As a first time business owner, I have NO idea what I'm doing most of the time and they helped explain things every step of the way. Would recommend Jewett City Savings  1,000%!",5
