The other day, Maria S. even left me a voicemail message reminding me to sign up for e-statements on a newly opened account so I wouldnâ€™t be charged for paper billing! Thank you, Maria, and thanks to everyone else there, too!!!",5

They have a hometown personable quality that is non existent in excessively large institutions. I never had as much as a hiccup with Liberty over the last 30 years that I have banked with them. If anyone gives them one star, it reflects more on that individual than it does the bank itself.",5

The two  other banks next to them, Citizens Bank and Bank of America, are willing to notarize a document, even though I am not a member, because I am a travel nurse serving their community. Here, at Liberty Bank, I was turned away.",1
