07/28/2023 18:31:10,Dibette Quito,Branch manager was horrible. Called to speak to him at 9 am didnt hear back until 2 pm. His excuse was he had customers and when I informed him I was a customer myself he didn‚Äôt seem to care. I had to push my closing date because there was no communication.  It‚Äôs 2023 and you can‚Äôt do a simple wire transfer from your phone.,1
