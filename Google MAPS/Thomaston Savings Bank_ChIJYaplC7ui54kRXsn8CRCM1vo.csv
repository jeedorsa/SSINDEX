02/24/2016 13:27:03,Food Critic,Have this bank for years and went to do some business on tues . Afternoon and to hold and behold this damn bank closes at 3. What bank closes at 3? I'm ferious. This bank doesn't not cater to the customer they worry about themselves . I think they forget businesses are open and doing business until at least 5. They give a whole new meaning of bankers hours. Try lazy hours,2
