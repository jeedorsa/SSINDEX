A follow-up call a few days later earned me a frosty response.  A few days later, an even frostier call made me realize these are not nice people.  We went to another source and received the best customer service, ever!  We are now happy campers, but wiser about this particular branch of Union Savings Bank.  Would not attempt to do business with them again.",1
