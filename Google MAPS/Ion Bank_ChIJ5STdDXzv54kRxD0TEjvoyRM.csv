01/22/2022 18:41:37,Melinda Szaniszlo,I went to this branch because the Rubber Ave branch in Naugatuck I usually go to and love was closed because of Covid and it is also walking distance from my workplace. When I entered two employees were talking and let me wait without even looking at me. Then one of the ladies came to me and told me she will be with me soon. I was waiting a couple of more minutes than I got seated. I had two questions on that day. The teller treated me like I was completely stupid. She was passive aggressive with all her responses and did not take the time to actually listen to what I was asking. By the time we finished our conversation I was swallowing my tears and left the bank without my issue  resolved. I will never go to that branch again. I hope the Rubber Ave branch will open up and I can go there where I was always treated well.,1
05/19/2018 15:27:36,Sara Gervais,Worst experience I ever had with a bank!!! Would rate zero stars if I could. I had so many problems dealing with the staff that I don‚Äôt even know where to start. I requested to have a new card because my current card was under the wrong name since my name changed they said it would take a week or two to come in. I NEVER received a card!! I had to keep using my card with the wrong info on it and I asked numerous times why it was taking so long and they said ‚Äúmust be lost in the mail‚Äù like are you serious?? And every time I needed to do a transaction at the bank they gave me attitude that the names didn‚Äôt match when it wasn‚Äôt even my fault that I didn‚Äôt have the correct name on there. Also there was a blonde girl who worked there I have no idea what her problem is but every time she saw me she gave me dirty looks and nothing but attitude. Also a number of times I had to give them ‚Äúproof‚Äù that I was who I say I am because the cards didn‚Äôt match (ps. I went there weekly pretty sure they knew who I was)... since they declined to give me a new one and every single transaction they gave me problems because of that. After 8 months of waiting for a new card and countless times requesting one that never came and the staff being hard to deal with I finally closed my account and when I was closing it they mentioned ‚Äúoh you could have gotten at temporary card‚Äù. ....are you serious???? Months of trouble and being stressed out from this and now you mention a temporary card??? Not once of the whole 8 months did they mentioned that to me. I‚Äôm so happy I no longer have an account there because it was stressful and difficult to do anything there and their staff has little to none customer service skills and I don‚Äôt think they even know how to do their job obviously. Ion bank is the worst do not go there!!!!!!!!!!!,1
