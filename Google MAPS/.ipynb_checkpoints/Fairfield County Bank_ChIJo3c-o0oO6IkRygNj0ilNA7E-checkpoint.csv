They provide wonderful services. I recently moved the account of a non profit organization to which I belong from one of the bigger banks to Fairfield County Bank. Wow! It was an easy transition so professionally handled by the Manager, Patty Connelly,  No more monthly management fees, first set of checks, very many, were free, and deposit stamp made free. Where else can you get all these services? Keep up the good job. I am on a mission to tell my friends and family to head to Fairfield County Bank, especially at 255 Tunxis Hill Road, Fairfield, CT 06825. Keep up the great job!

11/20/2020 17:39:18,STACEY H,"My husband and I have been banking with Fairfield County Bank for too many years to count now, and in all those years I must say that this bank is the best banking institution hands down.  We each own businesses and have tried other banks in an effort to keep our personal banking separate from our professional banking but none of them ever came close to the service and dedication that this bank offers.  All of their associates are excellent but if I had to single out an individual who has been a shining star to us, Patricia Connelly, the Manager of the Fairfield Branch comes up first every time!  Recently my husband had his car broken into and they stole important banking information which caused us to have to close and reopen all of our accounts with our banks.  I had been using Fairfield County Bank for family, personal and business for years but my husband was using Chase for his business account at the time.  Chase was so unprofessional during this process causing him to visit the branch several times with a different story of what needed to be done each time.  One phone call to Patty and she had all of the paperwork done for us when we came in, all documents were ready to sign for closing the old account and opening the new ones and the transition seemed almost seamless.  My husband closed his business account with Chase and now we have all of our accounts with Fairfield County Bank.  Thank you Patty, and Fairfield County Bank, for always being there to answer questions and doing such an amazing job for us all these years!!  So glad to know, especially now during COVID, that you are only a phone call away!!",5

02/13/2020 22:07:29,Martha Coppola,"We have known Virginia E. Turnbull, SVP, Senior Commercial Lender, Fairfield County Bank, a long time and from our very first dealings with her in the banking business have always found her to be fair, honest, and trustworthy.
When we started buying commercial property we immediately went to Virginia for mortgaging.  She was efficient and thorough collecting all the information needed to process and secure mortgages for us.  When she joined Fairfield County Bank, we went to her for a new mortgage, replacing the mortgage we held on a commercial property in Woodbury, CT; a mortgage we are continuing to pay down today.
Through Virginia we met Patricia Connelly, the manager of the Trumbull Branch then, now the Tunxis Hill Branch and the professionalism we found in both of these executives made us very comfortable with the Bank.  We have moved to Florida and continue to bank long distance with the Tunxis Hill Branch.  They are efficient in processing our mail deposits and are courteous and knowledgeable when we call the Branch for information or assistance.
Because of our good and long relationship with the Bank, we have recommended using Fairfield County Bank to numerous friends and colleagues.
