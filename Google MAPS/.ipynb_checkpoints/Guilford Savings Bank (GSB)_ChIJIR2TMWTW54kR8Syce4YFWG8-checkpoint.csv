Unfortunately, due to circumstances unresolvable according to GSB the application was mutually cancelled. I had already paid for the application fee and appraisal. I politely asked for the application fee to be reimbursed since our business didn't work out. I have since been ghosted for a month. It is truly unfortunate, I had such high aspirations too.",1

Every single visit i have made to this bank has reinforced my reasoning for remaining a member. The staff were always willing to help, understanding, and very informative. Many even remembered who i was, and went out of their way to make sure that my problems/requests were resolved. I can't give less than 5 stars for the amazing service i received at this small/local bank. The only cons i would have are not related to this business specifically, but rather issues faced by small business banks. I work nights so sleeping during the day makes it hard for me to stop by during open hours (which are limited). And the atm withdrawal limit does mean i suffer some inconvenience when i want to pay in cash. However, i am more than willing to deal with these insignificant issues as long as i live in New Haven county.",5

This is the worst GSB branch by a factor of ten.  Save yourself the trouble and bank with a different GSB location.,1
