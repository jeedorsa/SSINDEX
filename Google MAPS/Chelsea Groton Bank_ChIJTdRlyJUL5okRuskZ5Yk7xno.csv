They are quick and efficient, and I am always greeted with a smile and a hello as soon as I walk in. They have helped me with regular banking as well as opening a retirement savings account, complete with a free consultation with a financial advisor. Even though I have relocated I will continue banking here.",5
06/28/2021 16:17:11,Leah Lopes,As a bookkeeper I’m in contact with many different banks throughout the year. I’ve never had so much trouble in my entire career with a bank before. I would never recommend this bank to any person going into business. I’ve talked to customer care six times to resolve this issue and things are still not resolved at this time. Im appalled that first when I ask for business banking I don’t get transferred directly to them and then find myself in a position where the agent is unable to help me because they are not in business banking. And second The fact that my client has added me to both of his business accounts yet they still need approval to link my online banking to the account. It’s very frustrating. And although everyone I’ve talked to has been very nice at this bank I would never recommend them as they have not resolve the issue still and things have not been efficient at all.,1
