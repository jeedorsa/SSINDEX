I was told to get a calendar by Betsy. Told to remove auto payment from bill pay to prevent overdrafts occurring- when money was just in the wrong account.  Pay my bills manually following a calendar.

Sure that’s viable. But when I am asking what the bank can do to assist me and the first idea they have is adding tasks to my single man business operations. The solution is to find a new bank.  Get out while the getting is good. I’m going to Citizens.

There has to be a system for the bank to pull money from my other accounts or multiple solutions not creating more work for me",1

I can go years without seeing the then Branch Manager, now Assistant  VP and every time I go into the branch or call she still knows me by name. Banking well done! Wouldn't go to another bank.",5
06/06/2017 23:02:28,Tina Raymond,This is a great bank. There employees are so friendly and answers your question without hesitation. They call you by your name once they get to know you. I tell everyone that needs to open a account to go with them,5
