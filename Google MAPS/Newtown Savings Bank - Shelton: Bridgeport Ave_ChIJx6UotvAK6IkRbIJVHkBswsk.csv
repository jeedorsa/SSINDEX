Once I paid everything back I can not get a account rep to even call me back
About my business account
I have several personal and business accounts that I will be closing and taking my business else where
Sad because all I was looking for was an account rep I could chat with about my account once in while or to advise me if something was wrong with my account",1

Karissa took the time to explain everything to us not only about the mortgage process but about the entire home buying process and what to expect. She introduced us to the most amazing relator and as a team the two were unstoppable! We just closed on our dream home that in this day and age we didn't think would be possible. We cannot express how eternally grateful we are for all of Karissa's hard work, she is the best!",5

I walked in to this location in Shelton and was helped by Kristen and Katie. Katie listened very intently on what I was trying to accomplish for my banking needs and was SUPER helpful from the get go. Then Kristen took over and made things happen! I honestly felt like they were friends rather than just bank associates. I could tell they both genuinely cared and wanted to help me. You definitely don't find that at the BIG banks like BoA. I was so impressed with their service and customer service I decided to start the process and change banks. In the near future I will be finding out how they can help me with business banking needs bc I run my own insurance business. Last, Kristen needs to be in some sort of 'Olympics for banking' because I swear that girl could do everything with one hand tied behind her back and eyes blindfolded LOL Total pro both her and Katie. Thanks NSB so happy I stopped in!",5

Every single experience I have had with the branch in the last year has been horrible.  The lack of knowledge is huge. I have had to call the main branch to get simple banking done.  I will try another branch from now on but may have to change banks. It is just too frustrating.",1
03/27/2023 21:03:20,Keli Veillette,Customer service was unhelpful and calling was not worth the time. Paychecks cannot have holds placed on them and Newtown Savings should be responsible for any overdrafts due to the inability to process payroll.,1
