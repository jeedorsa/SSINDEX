04/22/2022 14:48:06,Maria Tomas,Lynne and Allison and the rest of the staff at Fairfield County Bank in Cranbury Branch are the most amazing people. There have been times when we needed something other than a deposit and the prompt attention we have received made our request so much easier to initiate. We have recommended this branch to family and friends. It is wonderful the relationship we have with this branch and wouldn’t go anywhere else.,5

The team she has under her at the bank are wonderful just like her and my experience banking there has been so good that I have recruited friends to bank there with her too! FCB, the dedication, volunteerism, and passion this woman has really sets the tone for the excellent nature of the bank overall! :)",5

07/14/2021 11:11:47,Golden Hawk,"My family has been banking at Fairfield County Bank for over 50 years and when ever my mother and i would arrive with any banking need they always made me feel welcome with their warmth and smiles. So as my family gets older and are no longer able to do the banking the responsibility of taking  care of house business has landed on me when i go to the bank now with a question or a problem -  i have always felt supported and  taking care of no matter how big or small the problem was, because they treat everyone like family.  Val the financial manager on a few occasions has gone above and beyond his duties to make sure I was being taking care of and Barbara Judson a darling teller just lights up the whole bank with her warmth and gentle nature making it a real joy to work and bank with them.  They are a community bank in every sense of the word and i am blessed to have grown up with them in my life.",5

I know and trust my multiple business accounts are in the best of hands at all times.  I would want them no where else.
