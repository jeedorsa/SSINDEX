This should be more than 1 person on duty for customer support.she was stressed but held together nicely and I was seen in timely manner.   Thank you ion Bank,4

You get a letter when you reach negative balance.   I logged into the website in January never mentioned it either.  This place steals from you doesn't notify you that your inactive.  How is this legal?  Stay away from here!",1

Iv been with this bank for so long and Iv gotten so fed up with it that im finally switching banks. First of all I went away on vacation and forgot to call them to let them know I was gonna be out of state. They locked me out of my account by locking my debet card. I called them and told me them that it was me using and the card and they said ok we will unlock it. Well they didnt and I had to call them 4 more times to get the card unlocked. Turns out they never did and I had to go to the main bank when I got back and get it taken care of. Iv had other problems with since then, pretty much everytime I call. The most recent thing to happen I had to report my card lost. I called them and asked them to send me another card. They said they were going to and that they put the order in. Well turns out when i called them today, they never put the order in. Now I have to wait even longer before ill have a card again. I dont understand why they cant get it together over there. So I do not recommend this bank to anyone. They are waste of time and a huge headache.",1
