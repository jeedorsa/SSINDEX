Although I hope I don't have to go through this hassle again, if I do, I will call Amy to help me through the problems again.  She is highly professional and I thank her again.

On a separate note, it is ridiculous to have a recovery process that takes 2+ weeks and is out of the staff's hands.  That is not in the least customer friendly.  The lockout was my problem through inadvertently responding incorrectly to the login questions.  That happens.  A recovery should be able to be effected immediately upon a phone call and verification.  On another note, your vendor, since I was told the problem was created by the mysterious vendor, is that you cannot automatically make international calls.  I am frequently in France and cannot receive phone calls except by human intervention, e.g. for wire transfers.  It would not be difficult to handle international calls so you would not simply remain a county bank.",5

Arianna has gone above and beyond for years— not only to help me navigate my banking needs, but also those of my family members who joint Fairfield County Bank on my recommendation.  We are grateful to Arianna for her constant support and guidance. Way to go, FCB!",5
