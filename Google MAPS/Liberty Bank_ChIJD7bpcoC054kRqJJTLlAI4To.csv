I asked her to link both of these accounts so that I could see both business accounts when I logged in. She claimed she sent the email to link them. However, my accounts were never linked by her request. I just called myself and had both accounts linked right away. I also asked her to order me some business checks. However, now that I just logged into my account I don't see that these checks were ordered since I don't see a charge for the checks. Andrea is very slow completing things for the customers. The manager should have her expedite things. Bad experience and will avoid going to this branch and go to another branch where I have had better experience.",1

I lost my debit card once and they went above and beyond to help me get a new one.  They know me by sight now, and always greet me in a professional manner. I’m very happy with their service, I’ve been a customer for 8 years and I will continue to be for many more.",5

I came from American Eagle Credit Union after being with them for 25 years and decided I needed a change. Big Mistake! As soon as I can, I am removing myself from this bank.",1
04/18/2017 20:21:09,Debbie Parafati,Worst possible experience at this bank time and time again! Different rules and different stories from every different person. They told me they were doing one thing with my account and did something completely different without my knowledge! I'll spare you the details but trust me - do yourself a favor and go somewhere else! Can't wait to get my money out of here!,1
