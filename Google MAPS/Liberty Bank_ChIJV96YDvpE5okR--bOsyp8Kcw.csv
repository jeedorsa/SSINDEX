The guy who wrote that their fees are high, staff is slow, and ATM is broken must not be talking about this bank or at least this branch.  ATM fees are refunded if you use another bank's ATM, and they have 2 ATMs at this branch so if one is busted, you can use the other one.  And, as I said, the staff is top notch.",5

Always smiling and ready to help. If there are days they are slow it is because they are so busy trying to help everyone they can. Have always taken great care of myself and whom I call my grandmother and no way they are a bad bank. I recommend without any doubts!",5
