03/22/2023 19:41:57,Andrew Church,"After the financial crisis of 2008 I decided it would be wise to diversify my banking relationships.  DR Bank seemed like a good fit as an addition to my much larger major bank.  The first thing I noticed when I walked in was how friendly and welcoming everyone was—the manager, the tellers, everyone made me feel right at home.  Once we got my accounts up and running I was very pleased to see that DR offers the same advanced level of service as the “big bank” with which I was accustomed.  I travel constantly, having reliable online access to banking is important to me, and I have not been disappointed.  By the time of this review I have been a loyal customer for 14 years.  I still enjoy walking in and seeing the staff when I’m in town, who are always happy to greet me, help me, and find out where I’ve been and what I’ve been up to.  By far the best thing to come out of the financial crisis of 2008 was my first visit to DR Bank!",5
03/10/2023 13:15:21,FigTree Designs,"We have an Interior Design business in Rowayton and have used DR Bank for many years for all our banking needs. Claudia and Tony are always very helpful and go above and beyond to make our lives easier when we are banking. They care for their customers, and even their customers dogs! Our dogs are always welcome, and get excited for a treat from Claudia. We love the warm and friendly atmosphere that is always present at DR bank.  We highly recommend the whole DR bank team!",5
03/08/2023 22:47:06,Elizabeth Hawes,"I've been banking with DR Bank since 2009 and I have been thrilled with them! They are truly a neighborhood bank, giving extremely personalized and friendly service. It's wonderful to walk in and they know your name and are quick to reach out whenever there is any type of issue with the accounts. I bank primarily at the Rowayton Branch; Claudia and Tony are the BEST, along with the rest of the team at the branch. I can't recommend them enough.",5
03/08/2023 17:06:11,Andrea Huntington,"I volunteer for a local non-profit who banks with DR Bank. We have been very happy with their service! They are responsive, timely and flexible in meeting our (small) but important financial needs. The location is very convenient and incredibly kind and welcoming staff.",5
03/17/2023 16:12:25,Jamison Davis,"We have banked with Morgan Stanley, Chase, and Citibank, but none compare to the superlative personal service of DR Bank where we have consolidated most of our accounts. Our relationship is overseen by two of the most dedicated bankers I have ever worked with - Arthur Murphy, Vice President and our day-to-day champion, Mallory Birmingham. I could not provide a higher endorsement of this great bank and the exemplary people we work with there. They are simply the best.",5
03/07/2023 19:33:50,SoNo Lacrosse,"I've been with Darien Rowayton bank going on 17 years for business and personal. I've also had during the same period for other businesses, People's,Chase and TD Banks. There is no comparison to customer service and personal attention. One needs personal attention in good times but especially when business is going through rough times such as 2020. I have the confidence in communication and follow through that keeps me here. The staff is great, not always turning over as in the other banks,  can answer my questions and address my concerns timely.",5
03/13/2023 19:39:51,Linc walworth,"Our family has been a client of DR Bank for over 20 years. The bank always provides great, personalized, service and ""goes the extra mile"" when our needs require it.  Special shout out to Claudia Carbonara for knowing how to get things done in a professional, caring, and friendly manner.  She's wonderful!",5
03/07/2023 19:15:32,Priscille Schwartz,"Our business has been banking with Drbank for many years and we have always had nothing but excellent service at their lovely Rowayton branch. The staff is very professional and knowledgeable and they make each and every customer feel welcomed as soon as they walk in the door. Their online banking is easy and friendly. Whenever we have an issue, they go above and beyond to help us out. Great experience and highly recommended for all your banking needs.",5
03/10/2023 14:40:46,Sheri Snow,"The company I work for uses DR Bank and, as the one-man accounting department, I am the main contact.  I can truly say they make banking a pleasure - they are always friendly, they understand the company and its needs and they go above and beyond in assisting us.  It's nice to have a local bank that knows us!",5
03/07/2023 19:33:09,Greg L,"Our family are long time customers of DR Bank in Rowayton and cannot speak more highly of the team.  The level of service and genuine care for their customers sets them apart from the competition.  I would strongly recommend Claudia, Tony and the DR Bank team.",5
03/11/2023 13:40:26,Dean Ravosa`,"There are not many businesses in town that you can walk into on a first name basis - but this is one of them.  The DR Bank team consistently provides incredible banking services, and they always go out of their way to take care of their clients on a personal basis.  Highly recommended.",5
03/07/2023 21:30:13,h d,"Never had a strong opinion about bank service prior to my experience with DR Bank's Rowayton branch. Banking simply was what it was, a slightly sales-ish tone to all interaction expected. But no exaggeration, that changed with DR Bank. I now honestly look forward to any visit to the friendly Rowayton confines, everyone there is such a delight, the mood authentically warm. In terms of account service, there is no comparison with what I receive from larger banks, every info request or question is answered same day and with detail by DR Bank staff. SO wish other banks would follow this branch's lead.",5
03/09/2023 18:25:53,Reel Communications,"The folks at the Rowayton branch are Excellent! Always courteous, attentive and efficient. Claudia and Tony are warm and friendly people- always ready to help. I look forward to seeing them when I need to go to the bank.",5
03/06/2023 14:52:47,CALVIC MMS,"The sweetest, most accommodating, professional, proficient bank in these area. I have never encountered a bank that totally helps as well as understands their customers. The manager John at Rowayton branch, Art and Dan at Darien branch are ABSOLUTELY the best ever!",5
03/14/2023 14:38:20,Mern Palmer-Smith,"I'd like to say a big thank you to the DR Bank and all the really  terrific people that work in the Darien Branch. I am a business owner in Darien. Double Exposure is my shop for 24 years now. I nearly went out of business during Covid. The big bank that I was with did not get the PPP loan for me that I desperately needed. I applied at the DR Bank at the last hour and I can honestly say that within two weeks I had the money from the triple P in my account which saved the shop from going out of business as so many other small businesses had. I am extremely grateful.
The people that work there are very professional and friendly and I like that.",5
03/07/2023 20:37:10,b 22,BEST customer service ever! I have been coming to Rowayton Bank for 15 years. Their service is unmatched. You can even CALL and speak to REAL people! Fabulous for teen accounts to.,5
03/13/2023 17:58:16,Peter Stuart,Theres nothing better than calling or emailing your local branch and having a person you know actually answer the phone or quickly return your email. At the bulge brackets you are just a number and your inquiry probably gets routed overseas. I enjoy walking into the office and chatting with the staff I have known for years. Great spot. Highly recommend.,5
10/30/2021 11:31:32,Jaison Joseph,DrBank is a very friendly bank and the manager Art is extremely professional and personable. We have. Business account and they take extra care if they see a charge coming they would call to verify if it’s correct or not. They go above and beyond to help. Pam in customer service is also quite  awesome. Her professionalism and conduct is really amazing.,4

03/02/2023 18:35:16,Hunter Pappin,"I’ve been very happy with DRB’s services relating to online banking. Their system works reliably, is easy to use and readily interfaces with my credit accounts, bill paying services at other institutions.",5
03/07/2023 14:11:29,Tracey S,"Claudia, Tony and the whole Darien/Rowayton team are always willing to go above and beyond to help their clients.  The experience is personable, friendly and always with a smile. A wonderful business in our small, charming town.",5

03/14/2023 21:35:14,Frani Taylor,We have 2 business accounts at DR Bank. Everyone at the bank is extremely helpful and friendly. The tellers greet me by name which I think is very special and it makes me feel welcome.,5

03/08/2023 00:47:31,Michael Parchment,"The team at DR Bank in Rowayton, especially Claudia and Anthony, understand the meaning of CUSTOMER SERVICE which has been lost throughout the service industry.  If you yearn for a true personal or commercial banking relationship, this is your branch.  - Michael P.",5
03/22/2023 17:45:21,Daniel Glazer,"DR is a fantastic, rock-solid institution. We value their presence in the community and are excited to work with them on current and future projects.",5

03/08/2023 19:57:53,Tom Gillespie,"I think the Rowayton branch of DRB is staffed by very friendly and helpful people.
They get to know you which takes the experience to a higher level.
Wonderful, very professional people!",5
03/11/2023 13:02:01,John Bainton,I love the local bank feel and service I get from DR Bank.  The bank tellers and managers are friendly and helpful when needed.  It is a true community bank.,5
03/03/2023 02:06:38,Alan Zoarne,This local bank has their act together.  Their IT is efficient and the employees are well trained.  Transactions that take an hour at the big banks are done in 10 minutes.,5

05/18/2017 17:02:57,Michael Sparrow,"Refinanced my loans from Myfedloan to DRB in 2015. Since then I have had nothing but positive interactions with them.

08/23/2018 18:36:20,Devin,"After applying for a personal loan and seeing the interest rate I decided to move forward. I supplied all required documents, but was told there was an issue with my bank account being less than 12 months old and that they would not disperse funds to that account. Considering I've had this account for 10+ years I was confused, but still provided bank statements from more than two years ago.

For the next two weeks my bank account information was ""under review"". I called every 3-4 days for an update and was told ""underwriting is still reviewing but we will know in 24-48 hours"".

Finally after two weeks I called and said I have been waiting for too long and was told they'd have an answer today. My application was denied due to ""bank account not meeting lender requirements"". I then spoke with the manager and supplied her with a document from my bank showing the 10+ year age of the account, and was still denied.
They offered no explanation and only told me to hand write and mail a letter to dispute the claim with underwriting, which considering the past two weeks and attempts to resolve issue would be a waste of my time.

Complete lack of communication on how to resolve issue, poor response time, and overall a waste of my time trying to fix an issue that was on their end.",1
03/08/2023 02:38:28,joe sequenzia,"I must say, DR Bank continues to come through, year after year. Claudia, Anthony and Mo are just the BEST! Thank you guys! You all rock!",5
03/07/2023 17:31:43,Vince Pisano,"If I were just rating the people who work at the Rowayton branch, it would be five stars, but only because I cannot give more. They are tremendous.",3
03/15/2019 15:26:03,Andrea McDonough,The banking personnel at the Darien Branch are awesome. The on-line banking service is HORRIBLE. I have spent so much time with customer service trying to set up my on-line account and still no on-line account. My husband did the same and had the same experience. Their system is so antiquated and non-customer friendly. We will close our account.,1
12/09/2015 16:43:39,David DePaul,"I have been informing people with student loan debt for almost 5 years now, somewhat of an expert in the field.  In most of my guidance, it ends in pointing borrowers towards refinancing their student loans through Darien Rowayton Bank for their excellent customer service and incredible rates. DRB has a hidden gem in the fact that they can pay off your student loans, consolidate into a lower payment and interest rate, and allow you to choose your term without a fee.  It breaks my heart that more people don't know about this option and are blindly paying on their student loans without touching the principal balance.  You CAN refinance your federal and private student loans through DRB, you just have to make the call or submit an application!",5
08/08/2016 13:11:43,Richard Weber,"I have personally had positive experiences with DRB. I used them for student loan refinance. The process can be long winded, but it's a highly regulated industry so it's not surprising.
The person who referred me to their services did not receive their referral bonus; however, so that is something that needs to be resolved.",4
03/07/2023 16:56:54,Joanne Steele,The Rowayton branch is outstanding. Incredible personal service. Claudia and Tony are exceptional!,5
03/10/2023 21:02:27,Josh Jewett,The Rowayton branch staff is wonderful. Incredibly kind and helpful. This is a great local bank.,5
04/16/2021 20:41:10,traci da silva,"These are predatory lenders.  Don't fall for them!  I took out a loan with them in 2019.  I had two payments - one in February 2021 and one in last 2020 that were fifty cents short.  They charged me late fees of $27 each time and reported my payments as late to the credit bureaus.  When I call I am unable to talk to a person who will help, but rather am told to send a ""secure email"".   The most recent response I have gotten is to pay the late fee.",1
03/06/2023 15:16:37,Teresa Marziano,Attentive and thoughtful customer service. The best combination of personalized service and more advanced banking tools- which are constantly improving.,5
12/17/2014 14:20:28,David C,Tried to refinance a student loan online. I have perfect credit and adequate income for the refinance. After applying and uploading all documents they denied and cancelled our loan saying you need $4000 month extra income after all bills are paid for a $12000 refinance? Please that is ridiculous! That information was not supplied up front.  Don't waste your time and a hit on your credit report.,2
01/22/2019 01:18:44,kathleen m,"Went into the fairfield branch to cash out a CD, and no one asked me for any form of i.d. The bank manager even signed off on the check. When i called the main office to complain, i was put on hold for 10 minutes then disconnected. No one bothered to call back.",1
03/02/2023 22:23:01,Sharon Feighery,"It is a pleasure to deal with Art Murphy at the Darien location.He is very organized and business oriented.
Sharon and Jack Feighery",5
01/09/2016 14:33:52,Justin Proctor,"The user interface is terrible to input your information.  You have to make sure your cursor is in the right place.  After filling out everything and getting my application approved, I was still not given a rate.  Instead I was given a large range of rates that I might get, but to find out more, I would have to upload pay stubs, etc.  I stopped here as I lost my trust in them.  They do not need that much information to tell me what rate I would have.  The documentation should only be to verify that what I said was the truth and the loan/rate should be contingent on that truth.",1
02/08/2018 19:18:26,Dustin Simmons,Attempted to refinance student loans with them. They did several clearly misleading and illegal tactics to get me to apply them changed the terms of the loan offer. Don't bank with a company you cannot trust,1
11/22/2015 16:38:52,Chris Carroll,Do not apply to refinance with them. It is a waste of your time. Their customer service is awful. They tell you 3-5 business days and you should have an answer. I waited 4 weeks before I got an answer. I called several times and they had no update for me. Take your business somewhere else. They do not deserve it.,1
05/15/2019 19:43:47,LJ,Terrible service.   Extremely difficult staff to work with...everything is wayyyy more complicated than it needs to be.  The staff that assesses the documents for loan approval are particularly pathetic.  It honestly may be worth it to pay a higher interest rate to not have to deal with this bank.,1
03/12/2023 19:03:07,Thomas Sweeney,DR Bank has always provided excellent customer service and has a friendly atmosphere.,5
02/08/2016 21:15:32,Ro Gal,"Have waited almost 6 weeks for their final answer after submitting all paper work and being approved.
After calling them a dozen times they kept telling me they are backed up and a decision would be made ""next week"".  After 6 weeks still nothing!  Do Not believe these people.  I don't know what their end game is but it isn't customer service or refinance of student loans",1

01/12/2021 18:48:42,Matthew Rappaport,They handled both my student loan and my PPP loan. I would recommend them without hesitation to both individuals and small businesses.,5
04/14/2017 04:25:30,Michael Foster,Executives at DRB are smart enough to understand the exact requirement of the students. They keep asking more and more about you so that they understand the exact loan requirement.,4
