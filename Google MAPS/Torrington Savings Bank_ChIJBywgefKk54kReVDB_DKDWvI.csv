I went to open multiple checking accounts and the process was so easy, I was legitimately surprised. I kept waiting for something to get complicated, but nope! Just great customer service. I have been using them for 3+ years now and not a single complaint! I'm planning to move my personal banking there ASAP. Thank you, TSB!",5
