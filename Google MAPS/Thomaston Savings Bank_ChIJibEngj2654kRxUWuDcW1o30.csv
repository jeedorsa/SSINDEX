07/06/2023 18:19:37,b r,Wow never in my life have I ever had such a rude bank manger. Itâ€™s a long story but both asst. manager  and head manager unprofessional. New customer local contractor in town of Bristol  and sadly closing my account here. I rather pay fee than be talked to the way I was and my poor 15 son  here at the middle st branch Bristol. Please stay away drive pass this bank!!!!!,1

If I had one recommendation for the owners of the bank it would be to improve online banking. No Face ID on it for iPhone users, and the server has gone down multiple times in the last few months or so making it inaccessible for a short period of time. But a good bank nonetheless.",5
