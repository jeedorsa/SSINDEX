07/09/2023 12:20:47,Nancy S,"The best bank and employees that work there.
I have been with this bank for 18 years.
I’m not a number, I am a person, greeted by name whether I call or visit.
I moved out of CT 13 years ago and decided against changing to a different bank.
I’m content with the services and reviews at FCB.
Read some reviews of the big banks and you’ll understand why I’m still there.
When you have staffing that stays on their jobs for a longtime, it’s obvious that FCB values their employees too.
A shoutout to the Mason St location.
Thank you Jeff and Laura.",5
