06/29/2023 16:42:36,Breanne Shipman,"Yamina Berrabeh-Mayen took the time this past week to help me set up a new debit card and assist me with the wallet application on my iphone and watch. She acted in a very friendly and professional manner. As far as I am concerned, I would recommend her for anyone needing help. That being said, all of the employees at Fairfield County Bank are extremely helpful and friendly. My family has been doing business with this bank for many years and we have greatly appreciated the professional, courteous, and prompt responses to our personal needs.",5

05/20/2023 10:28:02,Jonathon Salvato,"In the 3 years I‚Äôve been using Fairfield county bank I have had nothing but a horrible experience.  Their customer service is atrocious. The absolute worst bank to use if you own a small business by far.  All they do is look for any way possible to charge you their ridiculous fees over and over. As a small business, just me, it takes time to get invoices submitted to customers as I‚Äôm out working every day than need to do the billing myself.  The amount of fees I‚Äôve paid in the three years is insane not to mention they love those $10 daily negative balance charges while checks are processing for payment.  They don‚Äôt even have the curtesy to answer emails.  I sent a email to the manager of New Canaan Ave branch, Isaac Walcott, to never hear back plus a follow up asking about it to no response.  I would never recommend this bank to anyone, especially if you run a small business",1
03/17/2022 20:19:40,First Step,We have been doing our banking with Fairfield County Bank for over 10 years. All the employees are so friendly especially at the New Canaan branch.

All the employees are friendly and they provide a great customer service but Alicia Ochoa is always magnificent.  She provides an outstanding customer service, always with a smile and the most important for me is that she goes always an extra mile to help out and satisfy her customers.  Any company would be proud to have employees like her. I want to thanks Alicia for her great service.",5
08/11/2022 14:53:55,Michael Brzostek,My father was a member of the bank for many years. He recently passed away and everybody there knew him. I felt like I was being taking under their wing and helped me walk through the whole estate process. They were very protective of my dad's money making sure I had all the documents i's dotted and it's crossed. They were very professional in the entire process.

If you need assistance with any issue‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs making an overseas payment or opening a new savings account, Yamina Berrabeh-Mayen (Customer Service Representative in the Norwalk branch) is the person to contact! She‚Äôs a star employee‚ÄîI wouldn‚Äôt have been able to finally pay off my overseas student loan without her.

Website is awesome, all features BOA have and more.  You can see your credit score! They have a thing called Money Manager 360 where you can link all your accounts (credit card, mortgage, investment accounts ect) so you can see your bottom line (net worth) in one place.

And get this, the women who opened my account, Yamina Berrabeth-Mayen gave me her card.  I've called twice since opening the account, both times she picked up after a few rings.  Imagine that, talking to a live person at your local branch!

My only regret is not doing this years ago!",5
