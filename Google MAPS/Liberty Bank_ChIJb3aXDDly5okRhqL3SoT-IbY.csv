This has happened many times to me at various times of day. Going in is an option for some but many of us use drive through because of limited mobility.  During busy times managers or someone in the other offices should come help out with customers at the teller's window instead of one person trying to help walk in and drive through and backing up the whole process.",1
11/19/2020 21:52:20,Kat Startz,Local branches are amazing with great people.   Actual customer service people that help you when you call the 800 number are unbelievably incompetent with no follow-up and apparently a complete lack of communication with each other.   Each phone call yields a different answer to the same question.   I've had better follow up from my vet after my bunny got neutered than I do the people that I deal with money on and have an ira through.   Hope you never really need something from them.,3
