For the 8 years we have been working with them, Sheila has been welcoming, professional and available to assist us every time we walk through the door or call.  They care about their community and are sincerely interested in our agency and finding the best solution for our needs.  I highly recommend First County Bank, Sheila, and her Main Avenue team!

05/12/2022 19:19:04,Chris Frederick,"Where do I start? At first I had nothing good to say about this bank, I traveled to Connecticut this past weekend the D.C. area to be placed on an account of a close relative. Mine you I took train up and back just to handle this important affair for my relative. Today after receiving an email from the bank, I attempted to setup the online banking but was unable to do so. After contacting customer service I was meet, rudeness, someone not listening to what I said and just some of the worst customer service I have ever experienced.  After asking to speak with the representatives supervisor I was transferred to Sheila at the Norwalk branch.  I have nothing but kind words for her, she took the time to listen to my concerns and the issues that I was having setting up the online account. This type of customer service is lacking in today's society, Shelia called me back within 3 mins and stayed on the phone with me until I was able to sign in. She then took the time to explain to me how to access the pay my bills and apologized for the rudeness I had experienced. I thanked her for her assistance and felt the need to let First County Bank know what a Great employee they have in Sheila. If I lived in the area they would be gaining a  new customer and  because of her it is the only reason I have not asked my relative to consider changing to different financial institution.",4
