I think they are behind in technology. Clean easy to access location. Walk up ATM. Not sure if there is a drive through ATM. I wouldn’t recommend this bank based on feedback I’ve heard. I also won’t trash the bank because I don’t know enough. There is my 10 cents.",3

She was very patient and helped me by answering all questions I had about changing to this bank. I was also very impressed by the vast amount of knowledge she has and made the process 100x easier for me. Haven’t had this kind of customer service in any bank I am glad that I came to Dime Bank.,5
