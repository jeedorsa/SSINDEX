I have always been pleased with the service I receive at your branch. However, Ms. Linda's professionalism and ability to get to the bottom of the situation quickly exceeded my expectations.

Such a commitment to great customer service is to be commended. You can be sure that I will continue to do business with Liberty Bank for years to come.
Sincerely,

Mohammad Hasan.",5

I've worked at the same place, a local company, for a few years and was always able to cash my payroll checks on the spot. The other day, the polite banker told me they had changed their policy and couldn't cash the check; the money wouldn't be available for a day or two. I Explained how I'd had no problems doing this here, with the same check, for years. I asked to speak to her manager. She went over to the manager and came back without the manager, saying ""she said no."" I asked again, ""Can I speak to her?"" This time, the manager begrudgingly came over, graciously mblessing me with 2 minutes of her time. She was clearly burdened, did not express an ounce of understanding to my very reasonable points, and just kept saying ""it'll be available in 2 days."" Liberty, a local bank, has certainly lost its local charm and I will never bank with them again based on principle.",1
