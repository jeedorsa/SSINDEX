So I went to Union Savings. i LOVE them, the branch Manager knows who i am and remebers me. they also gave me a call to let me know that if you don't pay an over-drafted account i will get charged, unlike Chase who 1) NEVER told me they did the same thing & 2) when I did put money in my account to pay down what i owed them, the next day I  owed them more then B4 I put money in there. The people @ Union Savings are all SUPPER nice & I don't plan on taking my business to another bank till after I move out of CT and i will be sad to leave. But I do however highly recommend them to ANYONE! They give you the option to clean things if you don't have the money or decline it. I LOVE the Newtown Ct branch and all the employees and the branch manager is supper sweet! she is my favorite out of all the people there",5

I did not know her prior to walking in the front doors inquiring about a business checking  account. I've been with them for close to 3 years and do not plan on leaving. I hold a few accounts in a few banks, Union has treated me well.",5
