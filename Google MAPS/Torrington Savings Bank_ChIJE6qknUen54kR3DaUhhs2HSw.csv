04/11/2019 13:43:12,Georgia Austin,The Torrington Savings Bank branch in New Hartford is one of the best banks you will ever find.  My family has used TSB for more than 30 years.  You will not find better customer service at any other bank.  Their rules and procedures are there for your financial security.  We are so glad they are here in New Hartford!,5
01/15/2019 17:08:15,Those Guys,"After attempting to use the ATM and suffering through the $3 service charge, the ATM here has a locking mechanism that does not allow you to immediately take back your card; an increasingly common and inconvenient aspect in bank ATMs nowadays. My displeasure of having to pay $3 to remove 20 from my own account with a local bank, I have course forgot my ATM card in the Locking device.

2 hours later Upon returning when I realized I was without my ATM card, I went into the bank to claim it providing photo ID, and was probably told that for my own security my card was destroyed because a kind citizen had done the right thing and returned it. So, the policy of this bank is when somebody does the right thing, and then someone comes to claim their property with the proper ID within an extraordinarily reasonable amount of time, we're going to overly complicate your day by destroying the thing you rely upon for your business.

Thanks for making what would have been a simple problem substantially more difficult, and more time consuming.

I neglected to patronize your bank in the past for several reasons. I will add this one to the list as to why, despite being surrounded by this institution, I refuse to keep my money with them.
