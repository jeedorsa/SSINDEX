Every time I need to call someone to receive assistance I get an automated person that tells me that the bank is closed with absolutely no option to talk to someone even at the higher or cooperate level. I’ve been out of the Connecticut and needed assistance to speak to someone regarding my accounts and their would be no one to answer my questions which is very frustrating. I understand that yes the bank may be closed and everyone may be gone but a bank should definitely have a number to contact (1-800) in case of emergency assistance instead of giving me and option to leave a voicemail. I think we can all agree that if we needed something to be done then and there, that Ann automated voicemail would not please us in a time of need.",1

The transactions you made do not add up at the branch. If you pay attention everyday the account is a different amount even with no transactions. This bank is a total scam & steal money. DO NOT BANK HERE!!!",1
