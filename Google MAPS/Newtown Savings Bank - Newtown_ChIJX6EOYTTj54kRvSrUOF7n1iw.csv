There's no way to pay towards your principal, and if there's an increase due to escrow, they send you a long hard to follow statement and expect you to do the math yourself. The customer service is ridiculous and process of paying the monthly mortgage requires you to re-enter the SAME information each time, and double check there was no increase, as they don't tell you. HOWEVER they will be quick to penalize if the amount was not correct.",1

We have been trying to get a mortgage statement for my sons kindergarten registration for over a week now!  They still haven't provided one since their garbage online portal NEVER works.   Steve who signed us up for our mortgage is such a rude, condescending human I cannot believe he is still employed.   STAY FAR AWAY!!",1

Most banks don't do this but this bank does. They may even sue you for rent money on top of that. Lousy. No mercy, no compassion. They've got billions in assets.",1
