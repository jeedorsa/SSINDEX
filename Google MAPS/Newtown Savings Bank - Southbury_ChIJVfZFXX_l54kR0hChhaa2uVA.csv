09/19/2023 18:41:16,cheesis crust,"Tried to order a replacement debit card because the numbers that aren't raised numbers but somehow printed on my card are almost wore off and you can't see them anymore. I was told they could order and mail me one in a week and I said yes. Then was told I'd have to go into a branch. Went into the branch and was told they could give me a new card but it would have a new different debit card #. Hard to imagine there's no way to reprint a card with the same debit card #. What? With just about every bill i have being on an automatic payment through my debit card # that would be a huge pita! Seriously? I bet a scammer can probably print a card out with my number on it and use it, but my bank can't? Wow. When I used the zelle service which they offer in their mobile app to transfer money it withdrew the money from my account twice and sent it to the recipient twice. Called the bank and they said there was nothing they could do I needed to call the recipient and have them send the money back to me. Wow again! They offer the service but yet they're don't take any responsibility when there's an error on the part of that service which had nothing to do with me. ☹️",2

The new does not communicate with the old.  There is no way to access copies of checks from the old system. They also have no idea when or if you, the customer will have access to copies of checks from the old system. This is a huge oversight.
Whomever this boy wonder is, should be fired immediately! Whomever authorized boy wonder should also be fired! This is just a small example of their ignorance.  Do not do banking here!",1
08/15/2023 19:23:41,stacy Dudek,"Just went inside to make a quick deposit (Southbury branch) at 3:15 on Tuesday, (8/15/23) and there were 4 employees standing around complaining about a customer in the drive through, whose little dog was hanging out the car window, looking inside for a treat.  I thought it was the cutest thing and was about to say so, when one of the male tellers says “I hate little dogs!”  Then the female teller says, “I don’t like their high pitch barking.”   I wonder if they realize how offensive and mean they sounded.  Especially to someone that has small dogs and loves them very much.  As a veterinarian, I was shocked by their comments. I will stick with my hometown NSB branch in Woodbury from now on, since they ALWAYS treat my dogs with kindness and are happy to offer them a treat.",1
01/20/2020 17:48:05,N C,They don't give it their best effort for a home equity loan only.    The underwriter are unprofessional and  rude if they don't like your last name they will deny you a loan even if you qualify.   Would never recommend them to anyone . Very disappointed the way they handled things in an uncaring manner.  They are terrible for home loans but great for personal loan in communication.,1
