We loved your knowledge and your abilities to work with people. We want to say Thank you Mrs. Pantano from the bottom of our hearts. We hope to do business at Liberty Bank for the rest of our life.",5

If I have any issue it’s location, I’d love it if there were a Windsor (area) location, but for 22 years they’ve provided fantastic customer service and support and that’s more important to me than a 1/2 hour car ride. Thanks, Liberty Bank!!",5

06/21/2022 21:37:16,B Bii,"One word... lazy. I came in looking for copies of statements, as I have done many times in the past at other branches. The teller says she can “order” them, which takes a couple days, (but this doesn’t help me because I don’t live around here.) I’ve never been told this. Usually the teller just charges me, prints off the statements and I’m out the door, even if I have to come back same day and pick them up. This particular employee says she could do this, but they’re short staffed. Mind you, there was no other customer at the bank. Just me, the whole time I was in there. At least she said “sorry about that,” even though I doubt she meant it.",2
