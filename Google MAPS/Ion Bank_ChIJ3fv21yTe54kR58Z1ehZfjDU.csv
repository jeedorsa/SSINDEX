02/19/2024 13:22:12,Star,Very disappointed in their customer service inside of bank after teller stated my account was closed prior to asking me to confirm additional info. My account was NOT closed she just couldn't find my name correctly. Teller became defensive when I corrected them that I had just received my paycheck that same day and so how could my accountbe closed?  Now the only one ATM is out of service and now today is a bank holiday so unable to take out cash,3

Since then I've been very happy with their services and products and would recommend them to anyone in area for banking needs. I especially like their customer service. You actually can easily talk to a human at their service center in Naugatuck!,5
