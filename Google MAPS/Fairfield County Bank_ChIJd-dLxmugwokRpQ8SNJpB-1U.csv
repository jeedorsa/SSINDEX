Bank itself has worst customer service and policies I've experienced in any bank large or small, in 35+ years of banking throughout the US (and that's saying something, there's a lot of terrible banks out there).  Pretty absurd, unreasonable and unapologetic.  Find another bank.

I'll give one example of the half dozen or so ridiculous experiences I've had in just a couple months as a customer (which they actually make fairly difficult to become - almost as if they're doing you some kind of favor).  Traveling for business earlier this week, tried to access the account and apparently entered the wrong password.  Get a message that the account is now locked.  Tried again, account is locked.  One wrong attempt - and I don't even think it was wrong.  So I try to reset password....which you can't do without entering your account number - which I don't write down and is on my desk at home.  EVERY other bank I've EVER dealt with will allow a password reset or account access either with basic info, or with other info (SSN, etc.) - and if not through the website/app, then at least through calling in.  Called them Monday.  Not this bank.  Get back from trip last night, go to the password reset page and enter all required info - get a message that the account is locked, won't even send password reset.  Today is Thanksgiving, so almost a week without being able to access account.  Just one of many ""inconveniences"" and hassles and annoyances with this bank.  Absolutely gorgeous branches, and I appreciate the lollipops as much as the kids probably do....but how about focusing on being a helpful, useful bank?!?",1

08/17/2023 19:49:38,barbara rossi,"I can not say enough about Althea Francis, Branch Manager for the Darien office. She has gone above and beyond in her efforts to help me with my personal banking needs.
I don't think any banks today attempt to establish a personal relationship with their customers. But Althea did exactly that, she listened to me and provided a plan of action. She is a true professional who really does care about her customers.
Thank you Althea.",5

Ms. Francis gracious took to the time to gather all of the many documents that was needed. Thank you again, Althea for going above and beyond! I'm sure if my dad was able to, he would thank you personally for the many years of service you provided to our family!  Peace & Blessings to you! Shelia G",5

07/04/2020 19:31:35,Vincent/Samantha Hynes,"We just bought our first home and Andrew Coreau (of FCB) helped make it a great, painless experience.  He was able to answer any questions we had about the process and helped us keep to the budget that we knew was affordable.  In addition, Theresa Robinson (with the insurance division) was able to help get the best deal for our home insurance needs - also bundled with auto to get extra savings.  We would recommend Andrew and Theresa for home mortgage and insurance needs - and would certainly call them again if we were ever in the market for another house!",5

As a small business owner, this bank has set the bar so high that I dread the day I leave the geographic area and have to hunt for another bank that comes anywhere close to their level of service. Bravo and thank you!",5
02/06/2020 16:02:16,Scott Gentile,"Being in real estate you deal with lenders and mortgage people all the time.
I can definitively say that working with Andrew Coreau was hands down the best experience.  He always put the clients priorities and needs first and foremost.  He was extremely responsive and met every timeline that he committed to.  I highly recommend anyone looking for a mortgage to call Andrew Coreau!",5
