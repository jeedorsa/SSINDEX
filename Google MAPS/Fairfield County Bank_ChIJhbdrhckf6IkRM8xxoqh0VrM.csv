She went above and beyond to help me when I was coming in from out of town and had to take care of some emergency transactions for family members.  She scheduled time with me even though with COVID she was understaffed and extremely busy.  She rest assured me that everything would be okay and processed everything I needed quickly and efficiently.  This is an employee who has made a very difficult situation move along perfectly in a difficult time for my family and I.  Thank you again Therese for everything you have done.
Respectfully,
John Sexton",5
