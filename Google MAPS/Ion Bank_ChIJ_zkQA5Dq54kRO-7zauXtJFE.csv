She was extremely kind and considerate and explained everything I needed to know in order to cash my check without having an account there.

She explained everything, helped us set up our online banking, and even referred us to their mortgage department when we said we were moving back to the area.  She went above and beyond.  We are looking forward to banking with Ion in the future.",5
