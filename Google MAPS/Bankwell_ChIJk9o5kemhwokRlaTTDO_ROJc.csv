The Bankwell online banking and mobile app are very easy to use. I also like mobile check deposit tool, ability to link external banck accounts for ACH transaction, and the CardValet app to control debit card usage. There is also no minimum balance requirements and no monthly fees for checking and savings accounts. Furthermore, Bankwell provides instant ATM fee rebates and free P2P transactions, Popmoney.",5
