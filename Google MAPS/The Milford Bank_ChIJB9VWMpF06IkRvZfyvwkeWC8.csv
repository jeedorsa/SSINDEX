Handed my signature card to someone, another kept asking me for it‚Ä¶ simply communicate with your work colleagues for your customer and maybe I would consider 2 stars. Banks just want you money, no interest in helping.",1
05/15/2021 18:58:32,Ellen Beatty,"I enjoy banking locally "" wherre everybody knows your name"". Each f the tellers and all of the managerial staff have been most helpful. Initially, I had difficulty with the online transfer feature due to some browser incompatabilities. Once I added an alternative browser the issues have resolved. I particularly like the ability to call the bank and speak with a
"" human"" despite having facility and experience on-line. Keep up the good work and all you do for the Milford community.

09/15/2012 12:42:20,Gloria Powers,"After my mortgage loan request was turned down by 2 other banks, The Milford Bank was referred to me by my mortgage broker.  I was reluctant to go through the process again, as I was on a tight timeline.  Joann Sabas, my representative from Milford Bank encouraged me to give it another shot.  Joann kept in touch with me almost everyday, giving me the details, the updates, and support.  Yesterday, Sept 14th, Joann called me with the good news.  Milford Bank approved my loan.  I didn't need to put more money down, and I didn't need to get a co signer.  There is something to be said about working with a local bank, that cares about you as a customer, and not as a number.  I could go on and on, but see for yourself.  I highly recommend Milford Bank and Joann Sabas.",5
