The cashier, a middle aged blonde women, rudely refused to help with this simple task because I did not have an account.  The bank was empty and she was doing nothing but still could not be bothered.  This is something banks have always done as courtesy for their community regardless if you had an account or not.  It shows Ion employees simple do not care about the community at large.
Went down the street to TD and they made change for me with no hassle.",1
