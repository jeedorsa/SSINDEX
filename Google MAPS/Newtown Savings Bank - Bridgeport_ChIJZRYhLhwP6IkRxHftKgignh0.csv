Our Loan Officer was Natalie Espinal, and we cannot praise her highly enough. With such tight timelines for our purchase, Natlie truly went above and beyond to help us. In fact, there's a very good chance we would've not gotten the house had it not been for some of the rapid turnaronds Nataline managed! Thanks to Natlie and the rest of the folks at NSB, we are now happily living in a home that we love more and more each day. Thank you!",5
