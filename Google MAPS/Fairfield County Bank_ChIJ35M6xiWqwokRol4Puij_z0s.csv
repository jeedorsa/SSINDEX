06/26/2022 16:12:37,Amanda Cordano,"Walking into the sweet little branch office in Ridgefield, I was met with such a warm welcome and a very friendly staff. Most of my banking needs are easy to do online, however this one task needed to be done in person. The process was seamless and their professionalism combined with their outstanding customer service is a winning combination.",5
12/09/2022 17:27:26,Janet Benton,"The manager at the Ridgefield Main Street branch, Debbie Przewlocki, is a stellar manager and human being. She found potential fraud on our account, called immediately and multiple times to get through, closed our account, got a new account opened, and dealt with all the other issues involved, all while being incredibly kind and understanding. What a difference it makes at such a tough time to have someone so careful, competent, thorough, and caring to help us through this ordeal. THANK YOU, Debbie!",5

My usual branch is Main Street in Ridgefield. Each individual there is kinder and more helpful than the next. This comes as no surprise as their leader Kathy Graham is the embodiment of all that is good and right with Fairfield County Bank.",5
