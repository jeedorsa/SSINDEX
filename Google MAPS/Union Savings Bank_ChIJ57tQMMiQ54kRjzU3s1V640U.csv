Use this bank as a last resort of for savings only. DO NOT let this be your only payment method. Absolutely the worst bank ever. Better off carrying cash and ditch this bank.,1

When I paid it off, Union Savings Bank charged me $11,000 in fees! The bank didn't inform my attorney until the day of the closing. I wish I never had a mortgage with them.",2
