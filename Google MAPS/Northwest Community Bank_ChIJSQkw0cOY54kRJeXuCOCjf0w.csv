They do not offer any perks for their customers and their atm machines are outdated, the fees that they charge can also be ridiculous and you are limited to the usage of the ATM'S without getting hit with fees. If you are considering this bank I would suggest doing your research first and consider a better option.",3

I was told once they start kindergarten I can have their accounts changed to get the better interest rate. Well 6 of the 8 made it.  My two younger grandchildren now has to go to the bank and hear them make a speech. Well one of the grandchildren lives in NY so that won’t work. The other 6 grandchildren I just had to tell them that the child turned 5 and is going to kindergarten, now they have to listen to speeches to get a piggy bank. I don’t want the piggy bank for only two of the grandchildren, I want them to get the better interest!!",4

I've been trying to purchase a computer and have been unable to do so even though I have over $2000 more dollars in the account than is needed to purchase it. The problem is that there's apparently a daily limit you're allowed to spend. Excuse me? It's my money, first of all. I get that fraud protection is important, but I'm talking to them personally telling them it's alright and giving them all my personal information so they've verified it's me, but no one at the bank actually has the ability to allow me to spend my own money. So they have to call an administrator that takes an entire day to get back to them. And then they take at least half a day to get back to me.

So we figure that out. Finally my daily limit has been increased so I can buy this one item. It still doesn't go through. I call them again. Now they're telling me that because the bank the computer store uses is in another state, that's a problem apparently. So I can't buy it until they call the administrator again, tomorrow. And then it'll be the weekend. So at the earliest, I might be able to order the computer next week. Are you kidding me? I'm furious. I'm trying to be fair and reasonable, but this is not fair to me, this is not a good way to run a business, and I don't know how other banks conduct this process, but this is unacceptable for any bank and if I can find another bank to use so that I don't have to go through this again I'm going to switch banks.

This isn't about them protecting me. This is about them protecting themselves and holding onto their money. While the tellers are awesome, the institution itself clearly doesn't care about its patrons. I doubt any bank does, but these practices are totally out of line and I'm done.",2

Not that that is any of their business, lol. If it is NOT a paycheck, one is charged $5. My question, what is $5 fee for? Check is from NWCB, therefore it won't bounce. Who receives the $5 & why? Also, to all friends & family members who are members of NWCB, please do not write me a check. It's insulting to have to pay your bank to cash your check",1
