The woman at the desk was knowledgeable and got our account set up in less than an hour!
Beautiful branch with computer and printer access. Very excited to bank here",5
07/10/2022 16:49:09,ORane Mansolin,"Went to ion because its close to our storage warehouse to open a bank account . Met with one rep and then the manager came out and asked me to her office. She said without an ID no account could be opened, then implied that most ""black people"" do not have ID's and asked to see mine, then made a copy of it as if to say she wanted to verify it was real, as its not bank policy to make copies of Id's, after seeing the id she claimed the account would be opened, then cited that she would not open an account , after avoiding my calls the next day.

As soon as I entered the bank , I felt an aura of racism and bigotry. I felt that I should have left as soon as entered the doors. If you are black and visit the bank be prepared to be treated in the fashion racist ran establishments such as these behave towards people of color. The experience was horrible , it's sad to think we live in a day and age that a bank manager would imply that because a person is black they do not have proper paperwork and an ID to open a bank account, but that's what happened to me.

There was a time in American history when it was illegal for black people to have bank accounts because of their skin color, the bank manager at ion bank made me realize that those days are still active at her branch.

Racism is most certainly real, the bank manager is well aware of what she did and what her intentions were , she assumed that because I am black that I had no id or paperwork and literally said this. If she did it to me, she's been doing it to other people, if she did it to you ? speak up about it. The only way we can stop racists is by reporting them and their actions,. Being pacifist is not the way to go.",1
09/24/2018 20:42:00,Roots Wireless,I was surprised to meet the branch manager Mohammed walking into my store to introduce himself.  He was nearby meeting with another business customer and wanted to stop into local businesses to introduce himself.  I've never had my own bank who i have my account with come to visit me much less one I had nothing with.  I moved my personal account there and is in the works to move the business as well!!!! Old fashioned banking in the best way!,5

When I walked into the branch I was surprised to see so many things being offered to customers (computer, coffee, lounge area)  The employees were very friendly too.  Looking forward to the relationship as I'm convinced to move my banking here with Mr. Hassan. (who is such a respectful young man).",5

I don’t want to have to say something like this but I definitely felt racially discriminated against by one person in particular she had glasses and dark hair. And it was how she treated me every single time she was there for example one time I came to the drive thru area and I was ready to do a transaction so I pressed the call button I saw her go to the window, look at me she gave me a dirty look then went off do something else... 15 minutes went by sitting there with my car running someone pulls up in their car and is helped in one minute and they leave ..(they looked nothing like me) I pressed the call button again and she rudely says “you’ll be helped in a minute” another 10 minutes went by and finally she helped me and had an attitude towards me like she was disgusted she had to help me. I waited there probably almost half an hour with my car running. Every time I went to the bank she had an attitude towards me and was nice to people who looked different than me. Another time she helped me there was a problem in my bank account and she felt the need to tell me how I should be handling my money and to “watch it” first of all it’s none of her business to be making any comments on my personal affairs and trying to tell me how I should be doing things. The biggest problem I had with her and the bank was when my name changed so I did all the paperwork and sent a request for a new card. I asked if they do temporary cards she said “no we don’t do that here” and she told me I would receive a card in one or two weeks ... long story short I waited 8 months for a card that I never got and I kept asking numerous times why it was taking so long and I was always told “must be lost in the mail it’s not our problem” or “just wait another week or two” ...I finally closed my account because I couldn’t deal with it anymore and I was so stressed out every time I had to go to the bank because I knew I would run into more problems. Don’t ever go to a bank like this so unprofessional.",1
09/24/2018 20:37:57,Kathy Vendryes,"I can't say enough about the branch manager Mohammed Hassan!!!! He was my banker when he worked at another bank.  I was lost when he left and when I found out he was bank in banking, I quickly followed him.  I moved my banking and IRA, and homeowner's insurance and anything else I can I will to ION because of him.  What a smart and kind and understanding young man!!!!!!!!!!!! I've referred family and friends to him and will continue to!",5
01/08/2019 20:29:08,Jessica Gibbons,"This is the only branch I have a problem with. I had gotten into a verbal altercation with the person in front of me at the drive through and could clearly hear the attendant inside. I pull up and make my request. The tone and attitude of the attendant compleatly changed. I could understand if I gave her an attitude or was disrespectful to her, but I wasn't.",2
