Matt has helped me on multiple occasions. He always looks out for my best interest and is quick to respond on any task. He is great to work with and easy to trust with your money or investment. The rest of the staff is also very kind and helpful as well. Milford Bank is growing and evolving, but they constantly prove they still care about their customers (small or big) and maintain good relationships with them unlike other banks. I highly recommend Milford Bank to anyone looking for a bank they can trust with great customer service.",5
