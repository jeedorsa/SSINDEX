I went through the drive thru and it has the newer updated version ATM, which was/nice.
It is a typical Liberty Bank, which is good because I like them all...",5

The branch has no lobby ATM, so if the drive-through one is out of service (as it sometimes is) you either have to go inside and fill out a slip to make a checking account withdrawal or, if it's after hours, find yourself out of luck.

When I set up a business account here, the manager misspelled the name of my company and didn't enroll me in e-statements, prompting a 20-minute call to customer service to reverse the paper statement charges.

This branch doesn't have a change machine. Bank staff will instead request that you roll all your change for processing -- something I haven't done since the turn of the millennium.

Liberty Bank desperately needs to send upper management here to fix the myriad problems with this place.",1
