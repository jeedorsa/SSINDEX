Their new ChelseaLIVE application is great, and they always step up to help sponsor Norwich Events like the Fireworks. Great Community Bank. Norwich Events Organization",5

It was becoming so aggressive and I was responding and I guess she didn’t hear me responding over her own yelling. I was so uncomfortable. This has completely deterred me from using this location, it’s become so inconvenient and now I’m being harassed while trying to use this bank. I wouldn’t be surprised if Chelsea Groton is the next bank to fail.  I will be closing my account now. So disappointed by this behavior.",1
