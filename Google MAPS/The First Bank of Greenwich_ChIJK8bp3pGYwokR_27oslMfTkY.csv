I have done business with several banks in the town of Greenwich, both big and small, for personal and business and I can say with 100% confidence that I have never been treated better than I have at The First Bank of Greenwich.  I have come in or called up with questions about an account, mortgage or loan and I am always directed to someone that not only can help but takes the time to explain the answer as well.  Every person that works at this bank will treat you like someone special.  Thank you Frank and your entire staff for doing what you do, making banking easy and enjoyable!",5

We are so happy to deal with a bank where customers are not just account numbers.

It is sad to see a bank that exploits and disrespects senior citizens as they do.   Pathetic too, in a way, because it blocks the bank from working with an entire segment of the community.    If you're a senior citizen (or divorced), they treat you like garbage.   Pathetic.    ----    AARP Member",1
