She was very thorough and answered all of our questions. She took time to sit with us and explained everything. I later visited a coupe days later to open a business checking account. I can't express how great this personal one-on-one service  was - and it is so important. We never had this great of an experience with Chase or Citibank. We're so happy we're banking with Union Savings Bank now. Thanks, Darcy!",5

Michelle was very personable and helped me feel relaxed while opening my account, she walked me through the steps and provided everything I needed. I greatly appreciate everyone at the branch who Iâ€™ve interacted with.",5

05/07/2015 15:04:20,House of Warmth,Would NEVER recommend Union Savings bank for personal or business banking.  Their claims about helping small business....nope....customers best interest first....nope....meet the needs of their customers....nope....  I just had the WORST experience with them.  It was a total slap in the face and I immediately withdrew my money and will be taking my business elsewhere.,1
