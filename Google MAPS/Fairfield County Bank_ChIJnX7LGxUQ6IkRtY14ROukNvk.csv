JoAnn Sterling and her amazing staff at the Post Road branch not only know me by name but always help me whether I am calling on the phone or visiting them in person. There are not too many banking institutions that still offer this personal level of service  JoAnn always advises me on how to best utilize their accounts, services, to my best interest and convenience.",5

12/14/2021 01:11:50,Kim Feeney,Fairfield County Bank is genuinely a pleasure to do business with. I have opened several accounts there for my business and with my family. I especially love the Fairfield/Post Road branch. They always remember my name when I walk in; they‚Äôre always available to help when I have questions about my transactions; my local branch called me on my cell when there was suspicious activity on my account. Legitimately the best bank I‚Äôve ever kept accounts with.,5
10/09/2020 21:36:30,Kathleen F,I knew very little about finances and banking when my husband died nearly two years ago.  In the confusion of grief there are many decisions you need to make and you need to be able to trust and have confidence in the people helping you make these decisions.  The entire staff at Fairfield County Bank has been there for me from the very beginning.  They have guided me with their professional expertise and genuine caring manner.  I truly do not know how I would have managed during such a difficult time if it hadn't been for their patience and understanding. Always courteous and friendly even when explaining a simple transaction.  I know they have my best interest in mind when managing my finances.  Best decision I made in putting my trust in Fairfield County Bank.,5
10/20/2021 16:15:46,Rick Reyes (Del Mundo),"My experience at this Fairfield County banks branch location is nothing but joyful. The service is nothing less than spectacular. There  are tremendous benefits in doing business with a small bank, hometown bank you can never go wrong. They always there when you need them the most and they always remember your name. Manager Joann is a pleasure and always extremely caring and helpful. Shout out to Yeral and carmen.",5
10/19/2021 15:49:56,Frances Pierwola,"My experience with the Post Road branch of Fairfield County Bank has been beyond excellent.  I first met Joanne who helped me set up the accounts needed and introduced me to the bank's benefits.  Whenerver i have a problem she is ready and able to help. Yeral has been my personal assistant for  daily banking needs and is aways ready to offer help.  The rest of the team have  also been knowlegable and fast to offer assistance whenever I walk   into the bank.  These include Carmen, Woody,and Mary Ellen.    I don't know what i would do without my personal banking team. I came from some unhelpful, unpleasant banks with little but grief to offer me. I am thrilled at  the differences that the post road brach of my FCB has made in my banking life.    I plan to be with this brach for a long time.   The banking staff should be highly commended.",5

10/03/2020 17:48:47,Jennifer Sollenne,"Fairfield County Bank has been tremendously supportive to myself and my business partner over the past year as we have opened or own salon. From opening up last September JoAnn Sterling of the a Fairfield location recommended our Insurance Agent Scott, also from Fairfield County bank along with recommending several of her customers as we built our support system. She recommended our Attorney, Sign Designer, Electrician, Flooring Company and Caterer. She has been our connection to the community and so we are so happy to use other local small businesses! As this year has been incredibly tough and unpredictable during the pandemic, Fairfield County Bank was there for us with getting our PPP Loan. We have learned so much over the past year being new small business owners and we are very grateful for all the support from our bank! JoAnn and her team in Fairfield are so professional and caring. We have also used the Westport location for our day to day banking and Debbie and her team are wonderful to work with too!",5
